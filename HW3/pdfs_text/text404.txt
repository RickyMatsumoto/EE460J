Abstract
Making inferences from data streams is a perva-
sive problem in many modern data analysis ap-
plications. But it requires to address the prob-
lem of continuous model updating, and adapt to
changes or drifts in the underlying data gener-
ating distribution.
In this paper, we approach
these problems from a Bayesian perspective cov-
ering general conjugate exponential models. Our
proposal makes use of non-conjugate hierarchi-
cal priors to explicitly model temporal changes
of the model parameters. We also derive a novel
variational inference scheme which overcomes
the use of non-conjugate priors while maintain-
ing the computational efﬁciency of variational
methods over conjugate models. The approach is
validated on three real data sets over three latent
variable models.

1. Introduction

Flexible and computationally efﬁcient models for stream-
ing data are required in many machine learning applica-
tions, and in this paper we propose a new class of models
for these situations. Speciﬁcally, we are interested in mod-
els suitable for domains that exhibit changes in the under-
lying generative process (Gama et al., 2014). We envision
a situation, where one receives batches of data at discrete
points in time. As each new batch arrives, we want to glean
information from the new data, while also retaining rele-
vant information from the historical observations.

Our modelling is inspired by previous works on Bayesian
recursive estimation ( ¨Ozkan et al., 2013; K´arn`y, 2014),
power priors (Ibrahim & Chen, 2000) and exponential for-

getting approaches (Honkela & Valpola, 2003). However,
all of these methods were developed for slowly chang-
ing processes, where the rate of change anticipated by the
model is controlled by a quantity that must be set manu-
ally. Our solution, on the other hand, can accommodate
both gradual and abrupt concept drift by continuously as-
sessing the similarity between new and historic data using
a fully Bayesian paradigm.

Building Bayesian models for data streams raises compu-
tational problems, as data may arrive with high velocity
and is unbounded in size. We therefore develop an ap-
proximate variational inference technique based on a novel
lower-bound of the data likelihood function. The appropri-
ateness of the approach is investigated through experiments
using both synthetic and real-life data, giving encourag-
ing results. The proposed methods are released as part
of an open-source toolbox for scalable probabilistic ma-
chine learning (http://www.amidsttoolbox.com)
(Masegosa et al., 2017; 2016b; Caba˜nas et al., 2016).

2. Preliminaries

In this paper we focus on conjugate exponential Bayesian
network models for performing Bayesian learning on
streaming data. To simplify the presentation, we shall ini-
tially focus on the model structure shown in Figure 1 (a).
This model includes the observed data x = xi=1:N , global
hidden variables (or parameters) β = β1:M , a set of local
hidden variables z = z1:N , and a vector of ﬁxed (hyper)
parameters denoted by α. Notice how the dynamics of the
process is not included in the model of Figure 1 (a); the
model will be set in the context of data streams in Sec-
tion 4, where we extend it to incorporate explicit dynamics
over the (global) parameters to capture concept drift.

With the conditional distributions in the model belonging
to the exponential family, we have that all distributions are
of the following form

ln p(Y |pa(Y )) =

ln hY + ηY (pa(Y ))T tY (Y ) − aY (ηY (pa(Y ))),

where pa(Y ) denotes the parents of Y in the directed
acyclic graph of the induced Bayesian network model. The
scalar functions hY and aY (·) are the base measure and

the log-normalizer, respectively; the vector functions ηY (·)
and tY (·) are the natural parameters and the sufﬁcient
statistics vectors, respectively. The subscript Y means that
the associated functional forms may be different for the dif-
ferent factors of the model, but we may remove the sub-
script when clear from the context. By also requiring that
the distributions are conjugate, we have that the posterior
distribution for each variable in the model has the same
functional form as its prior distribution. Consequently,
learning (i.e. conditioning the model on observations) only
changes the values of the parameters of the model, and not
the functional form of the distributions.

Variational inference is a deterministic technique for ﬁnd-
ing tractable posterior distributions, denoted by q, which
approximates the Bayesian posterior, p(β, z|x), that is of-
ten intractable to compute. More speciﬁcally, by letting Q
be a set of possible approximations of this posterior, varia-
tional inference solves the following optimization problem
for any model in the conjugate exponential family:

min
q(β,z)∈Q

KL(q(β, z)|p(β, z|x)),

(1)

where KL denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence be-
tween two probability distributions.

In the mean ﬁeld variational approach the approximation
family Q is assumed to fully factorize. Extending the nota-
tion of Hoffman et al. (2013), we have that

q(β, z|λ, φ) =

q(βk|λk)

q(zi,j|φi,j),

(cid:89)

J
(cid:89)

i=1

j=1

where J is the number of local hidden variables, which is
assumed ﬁxed for all i = 1, . . . , N . The parameterizations
of the variational distributions are made explicit, in that λ
parameterize the variational distribution of β, while φ has
the same role for the variational distribution of z.

To solve the minimization problem in Equation (1), the

ln P (x) = L(λ, φ|x, αu) + KL(q(β, z|λ, φ)|p(β, z|x)),
(2)
where L(·|·) is a lower bound of ln P (x) since KL is non-
negative. x and αu are introduced in L’s notation to make
explicit the function’s dependency on x, the data sample,
and αu, the natural parameters of the prior over β. As
ln P (x) is constant, minimizing the KL term is equivalent
to maximizing the lower bound. Variational methods maxi-
mize this lower bound by applying a coordinate ascent that
iteratively updates the individual variational distributions
while holding the others ﬁxed (Winn & Bishop, 2005). The
key advantage of having a conjugate exponential model is
that the gradients of the L function can be always computed
in closed form (Winn & Bishop, 2005).

3. Related Work

Bayesian inference on streaming data has been widely stud-
ied (Ahmed et al., 2011; Doucet et al., 2000; Yao et al.,
2009). In the context of variational inference, there are two
main approaches. Ghahramani & Attias (2000); Broder-
ick et al. (2013) propose recursive Bayesian updating of
the variational approximation. The streaming variational
Bayes (SVB) algorithm (Broderick et al., 2013) is the most
known approach of this category. Alternatively, one could
cast the inference problem as a stochastic optimization
problem. Stochastic variational inference (SVI) (Hoffman
et al., 2013) and the closely related population variational
Bayes (PVB) (McInerney et al., 2015) are prominent exam-
ples from this group. SVI assumes the existence of a ﬁxed
data set observed in a sequential manner, and in particular
that this data set has a known ﬁnite size. This is unrealistic
when modeling data streams. PVB addresses this problem
by using the frequentist notion of a population distribution,
F, which is assumed to generate the data stream by repeat-
edly sampling M data points at the time. M parameterizes
the size of the population, and helps control the variance of
the population posterior. Unfortunately, M must be speci-
ﬁed by the user. No clear rule exists regarding how to set
it, and McInerney et al. (2015) show that its optimal value
may differ from one data stream to another.

The problem of Bayesian modeling of non-stationary data
streams (i.e., with concept drift (Gama et al., 2014)) is
not addressed by SVB, as it assumes data exchangeabil-
ity. An online variational inference method, which expo-
nentially forgets the variational parameters associated with
old data, was proposed by Honkela & Valpola (2003). The
so-called power prior approach (Ibrahim & Chen, 2000) is
also based on an exponential forgetting mechanisms, and
has nice theoretical properties (Ibrahim et al., 2003). Nev-
ertheless, both approaches rely on a hyper-parameter deter-
mining forgetting, which has to be set manually. PVB can

Bayesian Models of Data Streams with HPPs

also adapt to concept drift, because the variance of the vari-
ational posterior never decreases below a given threshold
indirectly controlled by M , but again, the hyper-parameter
has to be set manually.

A time series based modeling approach for concept drift us-
ing implicit transition models was pursued by ¨Ozkan et al.
(2013); K´arn`y (2014). Unfortunately, the implicit transi-
tion model depends on a hyper-parameter determining the
forgetting-factor, which has to be manually set. In this pa-
per we build on this approach, adapt it to variational set-
tings, and place a hierarchical prior on its forgetting param-
eter. This greatly improves the ﬂexibility and accuracy of
the resulting model when making inferences over drifting
data streams.

p(βt|x1:t−1), supported by an unknown transition model,
by the constraint

KL(p(βt|x1:t−1), pδ(βt|x1:t−1)) ≤ κ.

(5)

K´arn`y (2014) and ¨Ozkan et al. (2013) seek to approximate
p(βt|x1:t−1) by the distribution ˆp(βt|x1:t−1) having max-
imum entropy under the constraint in (5); for continuous
distributions the maximum entropy can be formulated rel-
ative to an uninformative prior density pu(βt), which cor-
responds to the Kullbach-Leibler divergence between the
two distributions. This approach ensures that we will not
underestimate the uncertainty in the parameter distribution
and the particular solution being sought takes the form

ˆp(βt|x1:t−1, ρt) ∝ pδ(βt|x1:t−1)ρtpu(βt)(1−ρt),

(6)

In this section we extend the model in Figure 1 (a) to also
account for the dynamics of the data stream being modeled.
We shall here assume that only the parameters β in Fig-
ure 1 (a) are time-varying, which we will indicate with the
subscript t, i.e., βt. First we brieﬂy describe the approach
on which the proposed model is based. Afterwards, we in-
troduce the hierarchical power prior and detail a variational
inference procedure for this model class.

4.1. Power Priors as Implicit Transition Models

In order to extend the model in Figure 1 (a) to data streams,
we may introduce a transition model p(βt|βt−1) to explic-
itly model the evolution of the parameters over time, en-
abling the estimation of the predictive density at time t:

(cid:90)

p(βt|x1:t−1) =

p(βt|βt−1)p(βt−1|x1:t−1)dβt−1.

(3)
However, this approach introduces two problems. First of
all, in non-stationary domains we may not have a single
transition model or the transition model may be unknown.
Secondly, if we seek to position the model within the con-
jugate exponential family in order to be able to compute
the gradients of L in closed-form, we need to ensure that
the distribution family for βt is its own conjugate distribu-
tion, thereby severely limiting model expressivity (we can,
e.g., not assign a Dirichlet distribution to βt).

Rather than explicitly modeling the evolution of the βt pa-
rameters as in Equation (3), we instead follow the approach
of K´arn`y (2014) and ¨Ozkan et al. (2013) who deﬁne the
time evolution model implicitly by constraining the max-
imum KL divergence over consecutive parameter distribu-
tions. Speciﬁcally, by deﬁning

pδ(βt|x1:t−1) =

(cid:90)

δ(βt − βt−1)p(βt−1|x1:t−1)dβt−1
(4)

where 0 ≤ ρt ≤ 1 is indirectly deﬁned by (5) which in turn
depends on the user deﬁned parameter κ.

In our streaming data setting we follow assumed den-
sity ﬁltering (Lauritzen, 1992) and the SVB approach
(Broderick et al., 2013) and employ the approximation
p(βt−1|x1:t−1) ≈ q(βt−1|λt−1), where q(βt−1|λt−1) is
the variational distribution calculated in the previous time
step. Using this approximation in (3) and (4), we can ex-
press pδ in terms of λt−1 in which case (6) becomes

ˆp(βt|λt−1, ρt) ∝ pδ(βt|λt−1)ρtpu(βt)(1−ρt),

(7)

which we use as the prior density for time step t. Now, if
pu(βt) belong to the same family as q(βt−1|λt−1), then
ˆp(βt|λt−1, ρt) will stay within the same family and have
natural parameters ρtλt−1 + (1 − ρt)αu, where αu are the
natural parameters of pu(βt). Thus, under this approach,
the transitioned posterior remains within the same expo-
nential family, so we can enjoy the full ﬂexibility of the
conjugate exponential family (i.e. computing gradients of
the L function in closed form), an option that would not
be available if one were to explicitly specify a transition
model as in Equation (3).

So, at each time step, we simply have to solve the follow-
ing variational problem, where only the prior changes with
respect to the original SVB approach,

arg max
λt,φt

L(λt, φt|xt, ρtλt−1 + (1 − ρt)αu).

As stated in the following lemma, this approach coincides
with the so-called power priors approach (Ibrahim & Chen,
2000), a term that we will also adopt in the following.

Lemma 1. The Bayesian updating scheme described by
Figure 1 (b) and Equation 6, but with ρt ﬁxed to a con-
stant value, is equivalent to the recursive application of

Bayesian Models of Data Streams with HPPs

the Bayesian updating scheme of power priors (Ibrahim &
Chen, 2000). This scheme is expressed as follows:

p(β|x1, x0, ρ) ∝ p(x1|β)p(x0|β)ρp(β),

where x0 and x1 is the observation at time 0 (historical
observation) and time 1 (current observation), respectively.

Proof sketch. Translate the recursive Bayesian updating
approach of power priors into an equivalent two time
slice model, where β0 is given a prior distribution p
and p(β1|β0) is a Dirac delta function.
The distri-
bution p(β1|x0, x1, ρ) in this model
to
p(β|x1, x0, ρ), which, in turn, is equivalent (up to pro-
portionality) to p(x1|β1)ˆp(β1|x0, ρt). Note that the last
ˆp term can alternatively be expressed as ˆp(β1|x0, ρt) ∝
(cid:3)
pδ(β1|x0)ρp(β1)1−ρ ∝ pδ(x0|β1)ρp(β1).

is equivalent

The perspective provided by Lemma 1 introduces a well
known result of power priors, which is also applicable in
the current context (see the discussion after Theorem 1 in
(Ibrahim et al., 2003)): “the power prior is an optimal prior
to use and in fact minimizes the convex combination of KL
divergences between two extremes: one in which no his-
torical data is used and the other in which the historical
data and current data are given equal weight.” As noted
in (Olesen et al., 1992; ¨Ozkan et al., 2013), this schema
works as a moving window with exponential forgetting of
past data, where the effective number of samples or, more
technically, the so-called equivalent sample size of the pos-
terior (Heckerman et al., 1995), converges to,

if the size of the data batches is constant1.

For the experimental results reported in Section 5 we shall
refer to the method outlined above as SVB with power pri-
ors (SVB-PP).

4.2. The Hierarchical Power Prior Model

In the approach taken by ¨Ozkan et al. (2013) (and, by ex-
tension, SVB-PP), the forgetting factor ρt is user-deﬁned.
In this paper, we instead pursue a (hierarchical) Bayesian
approach and introduce a prior distribution over ρt allowing
the distribution over ρt (and thereby the forgetting mecha-
nism) to adapt to the data stream.

As we shall see below, in order to support a variational up-
dating scheme we need to restrict the prior distribution over
ρt, effectively limiting the choice of prior distribution to

either an exponential distribution or a normal distribution
with ﬁxed variance, both of which should be truncated to
the interval [0, 1]. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, we
shall for now assume a truncated exponential distribution
with natural parameter γ as prior distribution over ρt:

p(ρt|γ) =

γ exp(−γρt)
1 − exp(−γ)

.

(9)

The resulting model can be illustrated as in Figure 1 (b).
We shall refer to models of this type as hierarchical power
prior (HPP) models.

4.3. Variational Updating

For updating the model distributions we pursue a varia-
tional approach, where we seek to maximize the evidence
lower bound L in Equation (2) for time step t. However,
since the model in Figure 1 (b) does not deﬁne a conjugate
exponential distribution due to the introduction of p(ρt) we
cannot maximize L directly. Instead we will derive a (dou-
ble) lower bound ˆL ( ˆL ≤ L) and use this lower bound as a
proxy for the updating rules for the variational posteriors.

(10)

where ωt is the variational parameter for the variational dis-
tribution for ρt; as we shall see later, ωt is a scalar and is
therefore not shown in boldface. For ease of presentation
we shall sometimes drop from LHP P (λt, φt, ωt|xt, λt−1)
the subscript as well as the explicit speciﬁcation of the pa-
rameters when these is otherwise clear from the context.
We now deﬁne ˆLHP P (λt, φt, ωt|xt, λt−1) as
ˆLHP P (λt, φt, ωt|xt, λt−1) = Eq[ln p(xt, Zt|βt)]

+ Eq[p(ρt|γ)] − Eq[ln q(Zt|φt)]
− Eq[q(βt|λt)] − Eq[q(ρt|ωt)],

(11)

which provide a lower bound for L.
Theorem 1. ˆLHP P gives a lower bound for LHP P :

ˆLHP P (λt, φt, ωt|xt, λt−1) ≤ LHP P (λt, φt, ωt|xt, λt−1).

1For instance, the ESS of a Beta distribution is equal to the
sum of the components of λt and, in turn, equal to the number of
data samples seen so far plus the prior’s pseudo-samples.

Proof sketch. The inequality derives by using Equa-
tion (12) and observing that ag(ρtλt−1 + (1 − ρt)αu) ≤
ρtag(λt−1) + (1 − ρt)ag(αu) because the log-normalizer

Bayesian Models of Data Streams with HPPs

ag is always a convex function (Wainwright et al., 2008).
(cid:3)
Full details are given in the supplementary material.

Rather than seeking to maximize L we will instead max-
imize ˆL. The gap between the two bounds is determined
only by the log-normalizer of ˆp(βt|λt−1, ρt):

ˆL − L = Eq[ρtag(λt−1) + (1 − ρt)ag(αu)
+ ag(ρtλt−1 + (1 − ρt)αu)]

(12)

Thus, maximizing ˆL wrt. the variational parameters λt and
φ also maxmizes L. By the same observation, we also have
that the (natural) gradients are consistent relative to the two
bounds:

Corollary 1.

ˆ∇λt

L = ˆ∇λt

ˆL

ˆ∇φt

L = ˆ∇φt

ˆL .

Proof. Follows immediately from Equation (12) because
(cid:3)
the difference does not depend of λt and φt.

Thus, updating the variational parameters λt and φt in HPP
models can be done as for regular conjugate exponential
models of the form in Figure 1.
In order to update ωt we rely on ˆL, which we can maximize
using the natural gradient wrt. ωt (Sato, 2001) and which
can be calculated in closed form for a restricted distribution
family for ρt.
Lemma 2. Assuming that the sufﬁcient statistics function
for ρt is the identity function, t(ρt) = ρt, then we have

ˆ∇ωt

ˆL =KL(q(βt|λt), pu(βt))

− KL(q(βt|λt), pδ(βt|λt−1)) + γ − ωt

(13)

Proof sketch. Based on a straightforward algebraic deriva-
tion of the gradient using standard properties of the expo-
nential family. Full details are given in the supplementary
(cid:3)
material.

Note that the truncated exponential distribution (see Equa-
tion (9)) satisﬁes the restriction expressed in Lemma 2, and
also note that the variational posterior q(ρt|ωt) will be a
truncated exponential density too.

On the other hand, observe that the form of the natu-
ral gradient of ωt have an intuitive semantic interpreta-
tion, which also extends to the coordinate ascent varia-
tional message passing framework (Winn & Bishop, 2005)
as shown by Masegosa et al. (2016a). Speciﬁcally, us-
ing the constant γ as a threshold, we see that if the un-
informed prior pu(βt) provides a better ﬁt to the varia-
tional posterior at time t than the variational parameters
λt from the previous time step (KL(q(βt|λt), pu(βt)) +

Figure 2. Relationship between ωt and Eq[ρt].

γ < KL(q(βt|λt), pδ(βt|λt−1))), then we will get a nega-
tive value for ωt when performing coordinate ascent using
Equation (13). This in turn implies that Eq[ρ] < 0.5 be-
cause Eq[ρ] = 1/(1 − e−ωt) − 1/ωt (plotted in Figure 2),
which means that we have a higher degree of forgetting for
past data. If ωt > 0 then Eq[ρ] > 0.5 and less past data is
forgotten. Figure 2 graphically illustrates this trade-off.

4.4. The Multiple Hierarchical Power Prior Model

The HPP model can immediately be extended to include
multiple power priors ρ(i)
, one for each global parameter
t
βi. In this model the ρ(i)
t ’s are pair-wise independent. The
latter ensures that optimizing the ˆL can be performed as
above, since the variational distribution for each ρ(i)
can
t
be updated independently of the other variational distribu-
tions over ρ(j)
, for j (cid:54)= i. This extended model allows lo-
cal model substructures to have different forgetting mecha-
nisms, thereby extending the expressivity of the model. We
shall refer to this extended model as a multiple hierarchical
power prior (MHPP) model.

5. Experiments

5.1. Experimental Set-up

In this section we will evaluate the following methods:

• Streaming variational Bayes (SVB).
• Four versions of Population Variational Bayes
(PVB)2: Population-size M equal to the average size
of each data-batch, or M equal to a ﬁxed value (M =
1 000 in Section 5.2 and M = 10 000 in Section 5.3).
Learning-rate ν = 0.1 or ν = 0.01.

• Two versions of SVB-PP: ρ = 0.9 or ρ = 0.99.
• Two versions of SVB-HPP: A single shared ρ (de-
noted SVB-HPP) or separate ρ(i) parameters (SVB-
MHPP).

The underlying variational engine is the VMP algorithm

justed. Notice that the values for this model is to be read off
the alternative y-axis. We can detect the the concept drift,
by identifying where the ESS rapidly declines.

Evolution of Expected Forgetting factor:
In Figure 4
(right) the series denoted “E[ρ] − 100” shows the evolution
of Eq[ρt] for the artiﬁcial data set. Notice how the model
clearly identiﬁes abrupt concept drift at time steps t = 30
and t = 60. The series denoted “E[ρ] − 1000” illustrates
the evolution of the parameter when we increase the batch
size to 1000 samples. We recognize a more conﬁdent as-
sessment about the absence of concept drift as more data is
made available.

5.3. Evaluation using Real Data Sets

5.3.1. DATA AND MODELS

For this evaluation we consider three real data sets from
different domains:

Electricity Market (Harries, 1999): The data set describes
the electricity market of two Australian states. It contains
45312 instances of 6 attributes, including a class label com-
paring the change of the electricity price related to a mov-
ing average of the last 24 hours. Each instance in the data
set represents 30 minutes of trading; during our analysis
we created batches such that xt contains all information
associated with month t.

The data is analyzed using a Bayesian linear regression
model. The binary class label is assumed to follow a Gaus-
sian distribution in order to ﬁt within the conjugate model
class. Similarly, the marginal densities of the predictive at-
tributes are also assumed to be Gaussian. The regression
coefﬁcients are given Gaussian prior distributions, and the
variance is given a Gamma prior. Note that the overall dis-
tribution does not fall inside the conditional conjugate ex-
ponential family (Hoffman et al., 2013), hence PVB cannot
be applied here, because lower-bound’s gradient cannot be
computed in closed-form.

GPS (Zheng et al., 2008; 2009; 2010): This data set con-
tains 17 621 GPS trajectories (time-stamped x and y coor-
dinates), totalling more than 4.5 million observations. To
reduce the data-size we kept only one out of every ten mea-
surements. We grouped the data so that xt contains all
data collected during hour t of the day, giving a total of
24 batches of this stream.

Here we employ a model with one independent Gaussian
mixture model per day of the week, each mixture with 5
components. This enables us to track changes in the users’
proﬁles across hours of the day, and also to monitor how
the changes are affected by the day of the week.

lower bound fell below 0.01%. All priors were uninforma-
tive, using either ﬂat Gaussians, ﬂat Gamma priors or uni-
form Dirichlet priors. We set γ = 0.1 for the HPP priors.
Variational parameters were randomly initialized using the
same seed for all methods.

5.2. Evaluation using an Artiﬁcial Data Set

First, we illustrate the behavior of the different approaches
in a controlled experimental setting: We produced an arti-
ﬁcial data stream by generating 100 samples (i.e., |xt| =
100) from a Binomial distribution at each time step. We ar-
tiﬁcially introduce concept drift by changing the parameter
p of the Binomial distribution: p = 0.2 for the ﬁrst 30 time
steps, then p = 0.5 for the following 30 time steps, and
ﬁnally p = 0.8 for the last 40 time steps. The data stream
was modelled using a Beta-Binomial model.

Parameter Estimation: Figure 3 shows the evolution of
Eq[βt] for the different methods. We recognize that SVB
simply generates a running average of the data, as it is not
able to adapt to the concept drift. The results from PVB
depend heavily on the learning rate ν, where the higher
learning rate, which results in the more aggressive forget-
ting, works better in this example. Recall, though, that ν
needs to be hand-tuned to achieve an optimal performance.
As expected, the choice of M does not have an impact,
because the present model has no local hidden variables
(cf. Section 3). SVB-PP produces results almost identi-
cal to PVB when ρ matches the learning rate of PVB (i.e.,
ρ = 1 − ν). Finally, SVB-HPP provides the best results,
almost mirroring the true model.

Equivalent Sample Size (ESS): Figure 4 (left) gives the
evolution of the equivalent sample size, ESSt, for the dif-
ferent methods 3. The ESS of PVB is always given by the
constant M . For SVB, the ESS monotonically increases
as more data is seen, while SVB-PP exhibits convergence
to the limiting value computed in Equation (8). A different
behaviour is observed for SVB-HPP: It is automatically ad-

3For this model, ESS is simply computed by summing up the

components of the λt deﬁning the Beta posterior.

around 50 000 customers over 62 (non-consecutive)
months. Three attributes were extracted per customer, in
addition to a class-label telling whether or not the customer
will default within the next 24 months.

We ﬁt a na¨ıve Bayes model to this data set, where the dis-
tribution at the leaf-nodes is 5-component mixture of Gaus-
sians distribution. The distribution over the mixture node is
shared by all the attributes, but not between the two classes
of customers.

A detailed description of all the models, including their
structure and their variational families, is given at the sup-
plementary material.

5.3.2. EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION

To evaluate the different methods discussed, we look at
the test marginal log-likelihood (TMLL). Speciﬁcally, each
data batch is randomly split in a train data set, xt, and a
test data set, ˜xt, containing two thirds and one third of
the data batch, respectively. Then, TMLLt is computed
(cid:82) p(˜xt, zt|βt)p(βt|xt)dztdβt. Figure 5
as TMLLt = 1
|˜xt|
(left) shows for each method the difference between its
TMLLt and that obtained by SVB (which is considered the
baseline method). To improve readability, we only plot the
results of the best performing method inside each group of
methods. The right-hand side of Figure 5 shows the devel-
opment of Eq[ρt] over time for SVB-HPP and SVB-MHPP.
For SVB-HPP we only have one ρt-parameter, and its value
is given by the solid line. SVB-MHPP utilizes one ρ(i) for
each variational parameter.4 In this case, we plot Eq[ρ(i)
]
t
at each point in time to indicate the variability between the
different estimates throughout the series. Finally, we com-
pute each method’s aggregated test marginal log-likelihood
measure (cid:80)T
t=1 TMLLt, and report these values in Table 1.
For the electricity data set, we can see that the two proposed
methods (SVB-HPP and SVB-MHPP) perform best. All
models are comparable during the ﬁrst nine months, which
is a period where our models detect no or very limited con-

cept drift (cf. top right plot or Figure 5). However, after
this period, both SVB-HPP and SVB-MHPP detects sub-
stantial drift, and is able to adapt better than the other meth-
ods, which appear unable to adjust to the complex concept
drift structure in the latter part of the data. SVB-HPP and
SVB-MHPP continue to behave at a similar level, mainly
because when drift happens it typically includes a high pro-
portion of the parameters of the model.

For the GPS data set, we can observe how the SVB-MHPP
is superior to the rest of the methods, particularly towards
the end of the series. When looking at Figure 5 (middle
right panel), we can see that a signiﬁcative proportion of
the model parameters are drifting (i.e., Eq[ρ(i)
] ≤ 0.05) at
t
all times, while another proportion of the parameters show
a quite stable behavior (ρ-values above 0.9). This complex
pattern is not captured well by SVB-HPP, which ends up
assuming no concept drift after the initial time-step.

The ﬁnancial data set shows a different behavior. Dur-
ing the ﬁrst months, SVB-MHPP slightly outperforms the
rest of the approaches, but after month 30, SVB-PP with
ρ = 0.9 is superior, with SVB-MHPP second. Looking at
the E[ρ(i)
]-values of SVB-MHPP, we observe that there is
t
signiﬁcant concept drift in some of the parameters over the
ﬁrst few months. However, only a few parameters exhibit
noteworthy drift after the ﬁrst third of the sequence. Ap-
parently, the simple SVB-PP approach has the upper hand
when the drift is constant and fairly limited, at least when
the optimal forgetting factor ρ has been identiﬁed.

We conclude this section by highlighting that the perfor-
mance of SVB-PP and PVB depend heavily on the hyper-
parameters of the model, cf. Table 1. As an example, con-
sider SVB-PP for the ﬁnancial data set. While it was the
best overall with ρ = 0.9, it is inferior to SVB-MHPP if
ρ = 0.99. Similarly, PVB’s performance is sensitive both
to ν (see in particular the results for the GPS data) and M
(ﬁnancial data). These hyper-parameters are hard to ﬁx,
as their optimal values depend on data characteristics (see
Broderick et al. (2013); McInerney et al. (2015) for similar
conclusions). We therefore believe that the fully Bayesian
formulation is an important strong point of our approach.

6. Conclusions and Future Work

We have introduced a new class of Bayesian models for
streaming data, able to capture changes in the underlying
generative process. Unlike existing solutions to this prob-
lem, aimed at modeling slowly changing processes, our
proposal is able to handle both abrupt and gradual concept
drift following a Bayesian approach. The new model ac-
counts for the dynamics of the data stream by assuming
that only the global parameters evolve over time. We intro-

duce the so-called hierarchical power priors, where a prior
on the learning rate is given allowing it to adapt to the data
stream. We have addressed the complexity of the under-
lying inference tasks by developing an approximate varia-
tional inference scheme that optimizes a novel lower bound
of the likelihood function.

As future work we aim to provide a sound approach to
semantically characterize concept drift by inspecting the
E[ρ(i)
t

] values provided by SVB-MHPP.
