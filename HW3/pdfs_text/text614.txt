Abstract

We propose a hierarchical approach for making
long-term predictions of future frames. To avoid
inherent compounding errors in recursive pixel-
level prediction, we propose to ﬁrst estimate high-
level structure in the input frames, then predict
how that structure evolves in the future, and ﬁ-
nally by observing a single frame from the past
and the predicted high-level structure, we con-
struct the future frames without having to observe
any of the pixel-level predictions. Long-term
video prediction is difﬁcult to perform by recur-
rently observing the predicted frames because the
small errors in pixel space exponentially amplify
as predictions are made deeper into the future.
Our approach prevents pixel-level error propa-
gation from happening by removing the need to
observe the predicted frames. Our model is built
with a combination of LSTM and analogy-based
encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks,
which independently predict the video structure
and generate the future frames, respectively. In
experiments, our model is evaluated on the Hu-
man3.6M and Penn Action datasets on the task of
long-term pixel-level video prediction of humans
performing actions and demonstrate signiﬁcantly
better results than the state-of-the-art.

1. Introduction
Learning to predict the future has emerged as an impor-
tant research problem in machine learning and artiﬁcial
intelligence. Given the great progress in recognition (e.g.,
(Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Szegedy et al., 2015)), predic-
tion becomes an essential module for intelligent agents to
plan actions or to make decisions in real-world application
scenarios (Jayaraman & Grauman, 2015; 2016; Finn et al.,

2016). For example, robots can quickly learn manipulation
skills when predicting the consequences of physical inter-
actions. Also, an autonomous car can brake or slow down
when predicting a person walking across the driving lane. In
this paper, we investigate long-term future frame prediction
that provides full descriptions of the visual world.

Recent recursive approaches to pixel-wise video prediction
highly depend on observing the generated frames in the
past to make predictions further into the future (Oh et al.,
2015; Mathieu et al., 2016; Goroshin et al., 2015; Srivas-
tava et al., 2015; Ranzato et al., 2014; Finn et al., 2016;
Villegas et al., 2017; Lotter et al., 2017). In order to make
reasonable long-term frame predictions in natural videos,
these approaches need to be highly robust to pixel-level
noise. However, the noise ampliﬁes quickly through time
until it overwhelms the signal. It is common that the ﬁrst
few prediction steps are of decent quality, but then the pre-
diction degrades dramatically until all the video context is
lost. Other existing works focus on predicting high-level se-
mantics, such as motion trajectories or action labels (Walker
et al., 2014; Yuen & Torralba, 2010; Lee, 2015), driven by
immediate applications (e.g., video surveillance). We note
that such high-level representations are the major factors for
explaining the pixel variations into the future. In this work
we assume that the high-dimensional video data is gener-
ated from low-dimensional high-level structures, which we
hypothesize will be critical for making long-term visual pre-
dictions. Our main contribution is the hierarchical approach
for video prediction that involves generative modeling of
video using high-level structures. Concretely, our algorithm
ﬁrst estimates high-level structures of observed frames, and
then predicts their future states, and ﬁnally generates future
frames conditioned on predicted high-level structures.

The prediction of future structure is performed by an LSTM
that observes a sequence of structures estimated by a CNN,
encodes the observed dynamics, and predicts the future se-
quence of such structures. We note that Fragkiadaki et al.
(2015) developed an LSTM architecture that can straight-
forwardly be adapted to our method. However, our main
contribution is the hierarchical approach for video predic-
tion, so we choose a simpler LSTM architecture to con-
vey our idea. Our approach then observes a single frame
from the past and predicts the entire future described by
the predicted structure sequence using an analogy-making

Learning to Generate Long-term Future via Hierarchical Prediction

network (Reed et al., 2015). In particular, we propose an
image generator that learns a shared embedding between
image and high-level structure information which allows us
convert an input image into a future image guided by the
structure difference between the input image and the future
image. We evaluate the proposed model on challenging
real-world human action video datasets. We use 2D human
poses as our high-level structures similar to Reed et al.
(2016a). Thus, our LSTM network models the dynamics of
human poses while our analogy-based image generator net-
work learns a joint image-pose embedding that allows the
pose difference between an observed frame and a predicted
frame to be transferred to image domain for future frame
generation. As a result, this pose-conditioned generation
strategy prevents our network from propagating prediction
errors through time, which in turn leads to very high quality
future frame generation for long periods of time. Overall,
the promising results of our approach suggest that it can be
greatly beneﬁcial to incorporate proper high-level structures
into the generative process.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: A review of the
related work is presented in Section 2. The overview of the
proposed algorithm is presented in Section 3. The network
conﬁgurations and their training algorithms are described
in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively. We present the
experimental details and results in Section 6, and conclude
the paper with discussions of future work in Section 7.

2. Related Work
Early work on future frame prediction focused on small
patches containing simple predictable motions (Sutskever
et al., 2009; Michalski et al., 2014; Mittelman et al., 2014)
and motions in real videos (Ranzato et al., 2014; Srivas-
tava et al., 2015). High resolution videos contain far more
complicated motion which cannot be modeled in a patch-
wise manner due to the well known aperture problem. The
aperture problem causes blockiness in predictions as we
move forward in time. Ranzato et al. (2014) tried to solve
blockiness by averaging over spatial displacements after
predicting patches; however, this approach does not work
for long-term predictions.

Recent approaches in video prediction have moved from pre-
dicting patches to full frame prediction. Oh et al. (2015) pro-
posed a network architecture for action conditioned video
prediction in Atari games. Mathieu et al. (2016) proposed
an adversarial loss for video prediction and a multi-scale
network architecture that results in high quality prediction
for a few timesteps in natural video; however, the frame pre-
diction quality degrades quickly. Finn et al. (2016) proposed
a network architecture to directly transform pixels from a
current frame into the next frame by predicting a distribution
over pixel motion from previous frames. Xue et al. (2016)
proposed a probabilistic model for predicting possible mo-

tions of a single input frame by training a motion encoder in
a variational autoencoder approach. Vondrick et al. (2016)
built a model that generates realistic looking video by sep-
arating background and foreground motion. Villegas et al.
(2017) improved the convolutional encoder/decoder archi-
tecture by separating motion and content features. Lotter
et al. (2017) built an architecture inspired by the predic-
tive coding concept in neuroscience literature that predicts
realistic looking frames.

All the previously mentioned approaches attempt to perform
video generation in a pixel-to-pixel process. We aim to
perform the prediction of future frames in video by taking a
hierarchical approach of ﬁrst predicting high-level structure
and then using the high-level structure to predict the future
in the video from a single frame input.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst hierarchical
approach to pixel-level video prediction. Our hierarchical
architecture makes it possible to generate good quality long-
term predictions that outperform current approaches. The
main success from our algorithm comes from the novel idea
of ﬁrst making high-level structure predictions which allows
us to observe a single image and generate the future video
by visual-structure analogy. Our image generator learns
a shared embedding between image and structure inputs
that allows us to transform high-level image features into a
future image driven by the predicted structure sequence.

3. Overview
This paper tackles the task of long-term video prediction in
a hierarchical perspective. Given the input high-level struc-
ture sequence p1:t and frame xt, our algorithm is asked to
predict the future structure sequence pt+1:t+T and subse-
quently generate frames xt+1:t+T . The problem with video
frame prediction originates from modeling pixels directly
in a sequence-to-sequence manner and attempting to gen-
erate frames in a recurrent fashion. Current state-of-the-art
approaches recurrently observe the predicted frames, which
causes rapidly increasing error accumulation through time.
Our objective is to avoid having to observe generated future
frames at all during the full video prediction procedure.

Figure 1 illustrates our hierarchical approach. Our full
pipeline consists of 1) performing high-level structure esti-
mation from the input sequence, 2) predicting a sequence of
future high-level structures, and 3) generating future images
from the predicted structures by visual-structure analogy-
making given an observed image and the predicted struc-
tures. We explore our idea by performing pixel-level video
prediction of human actions while treating human pose as
the high-level structure. Hourglass network (Newell et al.,
2016) is used for pose estimation on input images. Subse-
quently, a sequence-to-sequence LSTM-recurrent network
is trained to read the outputs of hourglass network and to

Figure 1. Overall hierarchical approach to pixel-level video prediction. Our algorithm ﬁrst observes frames from the past and estimate the
high-level structure, in this case human pose xy-coordinates, in each frame. The estimated structure is then used to predict the future
structures in a sequence to sequence manner. Finally, our algorithm takes the last observed frame, its estimated structure, and the predicted
structure sequence, in this case represented as heatmaps, and generates the future frames. Green denotes input to our network and red

predict the future pose sequence. Finally, we generate the
future frames by analogy making using pose relationship in
feature space to transform the last observed frame.

The proposed algorithm makes it possible to decompose the
task of video frame prediction to sub-tasks of future high-
level structure prediction and structure-conditioned frame
generation. By doing so, we remove the recursive depen-
dency of generated frames which have caused the compound
errors of pixel-level prediction in previous methods, which
allows us to perform very long-term video prediction.

4. Architecture
This section describes the architecture of the proposed al-
gorithm using human pose as a high-level structure. Our
full network is composed of two modules: an encoder-
decoder LSTM that observes and outputs xy-coordinates,
and an image generator that performs visual analogy-based
on high-level structure heatmaps constructed from the xy-
coordinates output from LSTM.

4.1. Future Prediction of High-Level Structures

Figure 2 illustrates our pose predictor. Our network ﬁrst
encodes the observed structure dynamics by

[ht, ct] = LSTM (pt, ht−1, ct−1) ,
(1)
where ht ∈ RH represents the observed dynamics up to
time t, ct ∈ RH is the memory cell that retains information
from the history of pose inputs, pt ∈ R2L is the pose at
time t (i.e., 2D coordinate positions of L joints). In order
to make a reasonable prediction of the future pose, LSTM
has to ﬁrst observe a few pose inputs to identify the type of
motion occurring in the pose sequence and how it is chang-
ing over time. LSTM also has to be able to remove noise
present in the input pose, which can come from annotation
error if using the dataset-provided pose annotation or pose
estimation error if using a pose estimation algorithm. After
a few pose inputs have been observed, LSTM generates the
future pose by

ˆpt = f (cid:0)w(cid:62)ht

(cid:1) ,

(2)

Figure 2. Illustration of our pose predictor. LSTM observes k
consecutive human pose inputs and predicts the pose for the next
T timesteps. Note that the human heatmaps are used for illustration
purposes, but our network observes and outputs xy-coordinates.

where w is a projection matrix, f is a function on the pro-
jection (i.e. tanh or identity), and ˆpt ∈ R2L is the predicted
pose. In the subsequent predictions, our LSTM does not
observe the previously generated pose. Not observing gen-
erated pose in LSTM prevents errors in the pose prediction
from being propagated into the future, and it also encour-
ages the LSTM internal representation to contain robust
high-level features that allow it to generate the future se-
quence from only the original observation. As a result, the
representation obtained in the pose input encoding phase
must obtain all the necessary information for generating the
correct action sequence in the decoding phase. After we
have set the human pose sequence for the future frames, we
proceed to generate the pixel-level visual future.

4.2. Image Generation by Visual-Structure Analogy

To synthesize the future frame given its pose structure, we
make a visual-structure analogy inspired by Reed et al.
(2015) following pt : pt+n :: xt : xt+n, read as "pt is to
pt+n as xt is to xt+n" as illustrated in Figure 3. Intuitively,
the future frame xt+n can be generated by transferring the
structure transformation from pt to pt+n to the observed
frame xt. Our image generator instantiates this idea using
a pose encoder fpose, an image encoder fimg and an image
decoder fdec. Speciﬁcally, fpose is a convolutional encoder
that specializes on identifying key pose features from the

the training strategies of the high-level structure LSTM and
of the visual-structure analogy network. We train our high-
level structure LSTM independent from the visual-structure
analogy network, but both are combined during test time to
perform video prediction.

5.1. Multi-Step Prediction

Our algorithm multi-step video prediction procedure is de-
scribed in Algorithm 1. Given input video frames, we use
the Hourglass network (Newell et al., 2016) to estimate
the human poses p1:k. High-level structure LSTM then
observes p1:k, and proceeds to generate a pose sequence
ˆpk+1:k+T where T is the desired number of time steps to
predict. Next, our visual-structure analogy network takes xk,
pk, and ˆpk+1:k+T and proceeds to generate future frames
ˆxk+1:k+T one by one. Note that the future frame prediction
is performed by observing pixel information from only xk,
that is, we never observe any of the predicted frames.

5.2. High-Level Structure LSTM Training

We employ a sequence-to-sequence approach to predict
the future structures (i.e. future human pose). Our LSTM
is unrolled for k timesteps to allow it to observe k pose
inputs before making any prediction. Then we minimize the
prediction loss deﬁned by

tion, and ml
k+t tells us whether a landmark is visible or
not (i.e. not present in the ground-truth). Intuitively, the
indicator function allows our LSTM to make a guess of the
non-visible landmarks even when not present at training.
Even in the absence of a few landmarks during training,
LSTM is able to internally understand the human structure
and observed motion. Our training strategy allows LSTM to
make a reasonable guess of the landmarks not present in the
training data by using the landmarks available as context.

pose input that reﬂects high-level human structure.1 fimg is
also a convolutional encoder that acts on an image input by
mapping the observed appearance into a feature space where
the pose feature transformations can be easily imposed to
synthesize the future frame using the convolutional decoder
fdec. The visual-structure analogy is then performed by

ˆxt+n = fdec (fpose (g (ˆpt+n)) − fpose (g (pt)) + fimg (xt)) ,
(3)
where ˆxt+n and ˆpt+n are the generated image and corre-
sponding predicted pose at time t + n, xt and pt are the
input image and corresponding estimated pose at time t, and
g (.) is a function that maps the output xy-coordinates from
LSTM into depth-concatenated L heatmaps.2 Intuitively,
fpose infers features whose “substractive" relationship is
the same subtractive relationship between xt+n and xt in
the feature space computed by fimg, i.e., fpose(g(ˆpt+n)) −
fpose(g(ˆpt)) ≈ fimg(xt+n) − fimg(xt). The network dia-
gram is illustrated in in Figure 4. The relationship discov-
ered by our network allows for highly non-linear transfor-
mations between images to be inferred by a simple addi-
tion/subtraction in feature space.

In this section, we ﬁrst summarize the multi-step video
prediction algorithm using our networks and then describe

catenated heatmaps of each landmark before computing features.

5.3. Visual-Structure Analogy Training

Training our network to transform an input image into a
target image that is too close in image space can lead to sub-
optimal parameters being learned due to the simplicity of
such task that requires only changing a few pixels. Because
of this, we train our network to perform random jumps in
time within a video clip. Speciﬁcally, we let our network
observe a frame xt and its corresponding human pose pt,
and force it to generate frame xt+n given pose pt+n, where
n is deﬁned randomly for every iteration at training time.
Training to jump to random frames in time gives our net-
work a clear signal the task at hand due to the large pixel
difference between frames far apart in time.

To train our network, we use the compound loss from Doso-
vitskiy & Brox (2016). Our network is optimized to mini-
mize the objective given by

L = Limg + Lfeat + LGen,

where Limg is the loss in image space deﬁned by

Limg = (cid:107)xt+n − ˆxt+n(cid:107)2
2,

where xt+n and ˆxt+n are the target and predicted frames,
respectively. The image loss intuitively guides our network
towards a rough blurry pixel-leven frame prediction that
reﬂects most details of the target image. Lfeat is the loss in
feature space deﬁne by

Lfeat = (cid:107)C1 (xt+n) − C1 (ˆxt+n) (cid:107)2
2
+ (cid:107)C2 (xt+n) − C2 (ˆxt+n) (cid:107)2
2,

(5)

(6)

(7)

where C1 (.) extracts features representing mostly image
appearance, and C2 (.) extracts features representing mostly
image structure. Combining appearance sensitive features
with structure sensitive features gives our network a learning
signal that allows it to make frame predictions with accurate
appearance while also enforcing correct structure. LGen is
the term in adversarial loss that allows our model to generate
realistic looking images and is deﬁned by

LGen = − log D ([pt+n, ˆxt+n]) ,

(8)

where xt+n is the target image, pt+n is the human pose
corresponding to the target image, and D (.) is the discrimi-
nator network in adversarial loss. This sub-loss allows our
network to generate images that reﬂect a similar level of
detail as the images observed in the training data.

During the optimization of D, we use the mismatch term
proposed by Reed et al. (2016b), which allows the discrimi-
nator D to become sensitive to mismatch between the gen-
eration and the condition. The discriminator loss is deﬁned
by

LDisc = − log D ([pt+n, xt+n])

− 0.5 log (1 − D ([pt+n, ˆxt+n]))
− 0.5 log (1 − D ([pt+n, xt])) ,

(9)

while optimizing our generator with respect to the adversar-
ial loss, the mismatch-aware term sends a stronger signal to
our generator resulting in higher quality image generation,
and network optimization. Essentially, having a discrimi-
nator that knows the correct structure-image relationship,
reduces the parameter search space of our generator while
optimizing to fool the discriminator into believing the gen-
erated image is real. The latter in combination with the rest
of loss terms allows our network to produce high quality
image generation given the structure condition.

6. Experiments
In this section, we present experiments on pixel-level
video prediction of human actions on the Penn Action
(Weiyu Zhang & Derpanis, 2013) and Human 3.6M datasets
(Ionescu et al., 2014). Pose landmarks and video frames
are normalized to be between -1 and 1, and frames are
cropped based on temporal tubes to remove as much back-
ground as possible while making sure the human of inter-
est is in all frames. For the feature similarity loss term
(Equation 7), we use we use the last convolutional layer
in AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) as C1, and the last
layer of the Hourglass Network in Newell et al. (2016) as
C2. We augmented the available video data by perform-
ing horizontal ﬂips randomly at training time for Penn
Action. Motion-based pixel-level quantitative evaluation
using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), analysis, and
control experiments can be found in the supplementary ma-
terial. For video illustration of our method, please refer to
the project website: https://sites.google.com/
a/umich.edu/rubenevillegas/hierch_vid.

We compare our method against two baselines based on
convolutional LSTM and optical ﬂow. A convolutional
LSTM baseline (Shi et al., 2015) was trained with adversar-
ial loss (Mathieu et al., 2016) and the feature similarity loss
(Equation 7). An optical ﬂow based baseline used the last
observed optical ﬂow (Farneback, 2003) to move the pixels
of the last observed frame into the future.

We follow a human psycho-physical quantitative evaluation
metric similar to Vondrick et al. (2016). Amazon Mechani-
cal Turk (AMT) workers are given a two-alternative choice
to indicate which of two videos looks more realistic. Specif-
ically, the workers are shown a pair of videos (generated by
two different methods) consisting of the same input frames
indicated by a green box and predicted frames indicated
by a red box, in addition to the action label of the video.
The workers are instructed to make their decision based on
the frames in the red box. Additionally, we train a Two-
stream action recognition network (Simonyan & Zisserman,
2014) on the Penn Action dataset and test on the generated
videos to evaluate if our network is able to generate videos
predicting the activities observed in the original dataset.
We do not perform action classiﬁcation experiments on the

movements and high motion similarity amongst actions.

Architectures. The sequence prediction LSTM is made of
a single layer encoder-decoder LSTM with tied parameters,
1024 hidden units, and tanh output activation. Note that
the decoder LSTM does not observe any inputs other than
the hidden units from the encoder LSTM as initial hidden
units. The image and pose encoders are built with the same
architecture as VGG16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) up
to the pooling layer, except that the pose encoder takes in
the pose heat-maps as an image made of L channels, and the
image encoder takes a regular 3-channel image. The decoder
is the mirrored architecture of the image encoder where
we perform unpooling followed by deconvolution, and a
ﬁnal tanh activation. The convolutional LSTM baseline is
built with the same architecture as the image encoder and
decoder, but there is a convolutional LSTM layer with the
same kernel size and number of channels as the last layer in
the image encoder connecting them.

6.1. Penn Action Dataset

Experimental setting. The Penn Action dataset is com-
posed of 2326 video sequences of 15 different actions and
13 human joint annotations for each sequence. To train our
image generator, we use the standard train split provided in
the dataset. To train our pose predictor, we sub-sample the
actions in the standard train-test split due to very noisy joint
ground-truth. We used videos from the actions of baseball
pitch, baseball swing, clean and jerk, golf swing, jumping
jacks, jump rope, tennis forehand, and tennis serve. Our
pose predictor is trained to observe 10 inputs and predict 32
steps, and tested on predicting up to 64 steps (some videos’
groundtruth end before 64 steps). Our image generator is
trained to make single random jumps within 30 steps into
the future. Our evaluations are performed on a single clip
that starts at the ﬁrst frame of each video.

AMT results. These experiments were performed by 66
unique workers, where a total of 1848 comparisons were
made (934 against convolutional LSTM and 914 against op-

tical ﬂow baseline). As shown in Table 2 and Figure 5, our
method is capable of generating more realistic sequences
compared to the baselines. Quantitatively, the action se-
quences generated by our network are perceptually higher
quality than the baselines and also predict the correct action
sequence. A relatively small (although still substantial) mar-
gin is observed when comparing to convolutional LSTM
for the jump rope action (i.e., 66.7% for ours vs 33.3% for
Convolutional LSTM). We hypothesize that convolutional
LSTM is able to do a reasonable job for this action class due
the highly cyclic motion nature of jumping up and down in
place. The remainder of the human actions contain more
complicated non-linear motion, which is much more com-
plicated to predict. Overall, our method outperforms the
baselines by a large margin (i.e. 82.4% for ours vs 17.6%
for Convolutional LSTM, and 86.1% for ours vs 13.9% for
Optical Flow). Side by side video comparison for all actions
can be found in our project website.

Action recognition results. To see whether the generated
videos contain actions that can fool a CNN trained for action
recognition, we train a Two-Stream CNN on the PennAc-
tion dataset. In Table 1, “Temporal Stream” denotes the
network that observes motion as concatenated optical ﬂow
(Farneback’s optical ﬂow) images as input, and “Spatial
Stream” denotes the network that observes single image as
input. “Combined” denotes the averaging of the output prob-
ability vectors from the Temporal and Spatial stream. “Real
test data” denotes evaluation on the ground-truth videos (i.e.
perfect prediction).

From Table 1, it is shown that our network is able to generate
videos that are far more representative of the correct action
compared to all baselines, in both Temporal and Spatial
stream, regardless of using a neural network as the judge.
When combining both Temporal and Spatial streams, our
network achieves the best quality videos in terms of making
a pixel-level prediction of the correct action.

as measure, and separated the test data based on amount
of motion, as suggested by Villegas et al. (2017). From
these experiments, we conclude that pixel-level evaluation
highly depends on predicting the exact future observed in
the ground-truth. Highest PSNR scores are achieved when
trajectories of the exact future is used to generate the fu-
ture frames. Due to space constraints, we ask the reader to

6.2. Human3.6M Dataset

settings. The Human3.6M dataset
Experimental
(Ionescu et al., 2014) is composed of 3.6 million 3D human
poses (we use the provided 2D pose projections) composed
of 32 joints and corresponding images taken from 11
professional actors in 17 scenarios. For training, we use
subjects number 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and test on subjects
number 9 and 11. Our pose predictor is trained to observe
10 inputs and predict 64 steps, and tested on predicting
128 steps. Our image generator is trained to make single
random jumps anywhere in the training videos. We evaluate
on a single clip from each test video that starts at the exact
middle of the video to make sure there is motion occurring.

AMT results. We collected a total of 2203 comparisons
(1086 against convolutional LSTM and 1117 against optical
ﬂow baseline) from 71 unique workers. As shown in Ta-
ble 3, the videos generated by our network are perceptually
higher quality and reﬂect a reasonable future compared to
the baselines on average. Unexpectedly, our network does
not perform well on videos where the action involves mini-
mal motion, such as sitting, sitting down, eating, taking a
photo, and waiting. These actions usually involve the person
staying still or making very unnoticeable motion which can
result in a static prediction (by convolutional LSTM and/or
optical ﬂow) making frames look far more realistic than the
prediction from our network. Overall, our method outper-
forms the baselines by a large margin (i.e. 70.3% for ours
vs 29.7% for Convolutional LSTM, and 72.3% for ours vs
27.7% for Optical Flow). Figure 5 shows that our network
generates far higher quality future frames compared to the
convolutional LSTM baseline. Side by side video compari-
son for all actions can be found in our project website.

Pixel-level evaluation and control experiments. Fol-
lowing the same procedure as Section 6.1, we evaluated
the predicted videos using PSNR and separated the test data
by motion. Due to the high uncertainty and number of pre-
diction steps in these videos, the predicted future can largely
deviate from the exact future observed in the ground-truth.
The highest PSNR scores are again achieved when the exact
future pose is used to generate the video frames; however,
there is an even larger gap compared to the results in Sec-
tion 6.1. Due to space constraints, we ask the reader to
please refer to the supplementary material for more detailed
quantitative and qualitative analysis.

7. Conclusion and Future Work
We propose a hierarchical approach of pixel-level video
prediction. Using human action videos as benchmark, we
have demonstrated that our hierarchical prediction approach
is able to predict up to 128 future frames, which is an order
of magnitude improvement in terms of effective temporal
scale of the prediction.

The success of our approach demonstrates that it can be
greatly beneﬁcial to incorporate the proper high-level struc-
ture into the generative process. At the same time, an impor-
tant open research question would be how to automatically
learn such structures without domain knowledge. We leave
this as future work.

Another limitation of this work is that it generates a single
future trajectory. For an agent to make a better estimation
of what the future looks like, we would need more than one
generated future. Future work will involve the generation of
many futures given using a probabilistic sequence model.
Finally, our model does not handle background motion. This
is a highly challenging task since background comes in and
out of sight. Predicting background motion will require a
generative model that hallucinates the unseen background.
We also leave this as future work.

Figure 5. Qualitative evaluation of our network for 55 step prediction on Penn Action (top rows), and 109 step prediction on Human3.6M
(bottom rows). Our algorithm observes 10 previous input frames, estimates the human pose, predicts the pose sequence of the future, and
it ﬁnally generates the future frames. Green box denotes input and red box denotes prediction. We show the last 7 input frames. Side by
side video comparisons can be found in our project website.
