A. Derivation of the Conditionals

Here we derive the full conditional for a latent variable znl as stated in eq. (4). The expression for uld is analogous. We
start from the full joint:

p(X, U , Z, λ) = p(X|U , Z, λ)p(Z)p(U )p(λ) .

We drop terms that do not depend on znl, and plug in the likelihood from eq. (3):
(cid:35)

(cid:34)

p(znl| · ) ∝

σ

λ˜xnd(1−2

(1−znl(cid:48)ul(cid:48)d))

p(znl) .

(cid:89)

d

(cid:89)

l(cid:48)

Next, we normalise this expression for znl ∈ [0, 1] and restrict to znl = 1 for simplicity:

(cid:34)

p(znl = 1| · ) = σ

logit(p(znl) +

(cid:88)

log

d

1+ exp[−λ˜xnd (1−2 (cid:81)
1+ exp[−λ˜xnd (1−2 (cid:81)

l(cid:48) (1−znl(cid:48)ul(cid:48)d))]znl=0
l(cid:48) (1−znl(cid:48)ul(cid:48)d))]znl=1

(cid:35)

.

(9)

We can distinctly simplify the second line of equation eq. (9) by distinguishing the two possible contributions to the sum.
Changing znl from 0 to 1 in the fraction inside the sum can have the following two consequences:

1. Numerator and denominator remain equal, then the contribution to the sum is zero.

2. The numerator’s exponent evaluates to λ˜xnd and the denominator’s exponent to −λ˜xnd, then the contribution to the

sum is λ˜xnd, as we can see by using the identity log(1 + ex) − log(1 + e−x) = x.

For scenario 2 to take place, we can see from eq. (9) that two conditions need to be met:

1. uld = 1. Otherwise, the value znl does not effect the likelihood. Viewed es directed graphical model, there would be

no link between znl and xnd.

would be explained away.

2. zn(cid:48)lul(cid:48)d = 0 ∀ l(cid:48) (cid:54)= l. Otherwise, another parent already explains xnd. Viewed as directed graphical model, xnd

Thus we ﬁnd the equality for the fraction in eq. (9):

(cid:88)

log

d

1+ exp[−λ˜xnd (1−2 (cid:81)
1+ exp[−λ˜xnd (1−2 (cid:81)

l(cid:48) (1−znl(cid:48)ul(cid:48)d))]znl=0
l(cid:48) (1−znl(cid:48)ul(cid:48)d))]znl=1

(cid:88)

= λ

d

˜xnduld

(1−znl(cid:48)ul(cid:48)d) .

This leads to the full conditional as given in eq. (4):



p(znl| · ) = σ

logit(p(znl))+λ˜znl

˜xnduld

(1−znl(cid:48)ul(cid:48)d)

 .

l(cid:48)(cid:54)=l

(cid:89)

l(cid:48)(cid:54)=l
