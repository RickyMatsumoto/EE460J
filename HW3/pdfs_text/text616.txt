Abstract
It is well known that it is challenging to train
deep neural networks and recurrent neural net-
works for tasks that exhibit long term dependen-
cies. The vanishing or exploding gradient prob-
lem is a well known issue associated with these
challenges. One approach to addressing vanish-
ing and exploding gradients is to use either soft
or hard constraints on weight matrices so as to
encourage or enforce orthogonality. Orthogo-
nal matrices preserve gradient norm during back-
propagation and may therefore be a desirable
property. This paper explores issues with opti-
mization convergence, speed and gradient stabil-
ity when encouraging or enforcing orthogonality.
To perform this analysis, we propose a weight
matrix factorization and parameterization strat-
egy through which we can bound matrix norms
and therein control the degree of expansivity in-
duced during backpropagation. We ﬁnd that hard
constraints on orthogonality can negatively af-
fect the speed of convergence and model perfor-
mance.

1. Introduction

The depth of deep neural networks confers representational
power, but also makes model optimization more challeng-
ing. Training deep networks with gradient descent based
methods is known to be difﬁcult as a consequence of the
vanishing and exploding gradient problem (Hochreiter &
Schmidhuber, 1997). Typically, exploding gradients are
avoided by clipping large gradients (Pascanu et al., 2013)
or introducing an L2 or L1 weight norm penalty. The latter
has the effect of bounding the spectral radius of the linear
transformations, thus limiting the maximal gain across the
transformation. Krueger & Memisevic (2015) attempt to

stabilize the norm of propagating signals directly by penal-
izing differences in successive norm pairs in the forward
pass and Pascanu et al. (2013) propose to penalize succes-
sive gradient norm pairs in the backward pass. These regu-
larizers affect the network parameterization with respect to
the data instead of penalizing weights directly.

Both expansivity and contractivity of linear transforma-
tions can also be limited by more tightly bounding their
spectra. By limiting the transformations to be orthogonal,
their singular spectra are limited to unitary gain causing
the transformations to be norm-preserving. Le et al. (2015)
and Henaff et al. (2016) have respectively shown that iden-
tity initialization and orthogonal initialization can be ben-
eﬁcial. Arjovsky et al. (2015) have gone beyond initial-
ization, building unitary recurrent neural network (RNN)
models with transformations that are unitary by construc-
tion which they achieved by composing multiple basic uni-
tary transformations. The resulting transformations, for
some n-dimensional input, cover only some subset of pos-
sible n × n unitary matrices but appear to perform well on
simple tasks and have the beneﬁt of having low complexity
in memory and computation.

The entire set of possible unitary or orthogonal parame-
terizations forms the Stiefel manifold. At a much higher
computational cost, gradient descent optimization directly
along this manifold can be done via geodesic steps (Nishi-
mori, 2005; Tagare, 2011). Recent work (Wisdom et al.,
2016) has proposed the optimization of unitary matrices
along the Stiefel manifold using geodesic gradient descent.
To produce a full-capacity parameterization for unitary ma-
trices they use some insights from Tagare (2011), combin-
ing the use of canonical inner products and Cayley transfor-
mations. Their experimental work indicates that full capac-
ity unitary RNN models can solve the copy memory prob-
lem whereas both LSTM networks and restricted capacity
unitary RNN models having similar complexity appear un-
able to solve the task for a longer sequence length (T =
2000). (Harandi & Fernando, 2016) also ﬁnd that the use of
fully connected “Stiefel layers” improves the performance
of some convolutional neural networks.

We seek to gain a new perspective on this line of re-
search by exploring the optimization of real valued matri-
ces within a conﬁgurable margin about the Stiefel mani-

fold. We suspect that a strong constraint of orthogonality
limits the model’s representational power, hindering its per-
formance, and may make optimization more difﬁcult. We
explore this hypothesis empirically by employing a factor-
ization technique that allows us to limit the degree of devia-
tion from the Stiefel manifold. While we use geodesic gra-
dient descent, we simultaneously update the singular spec-
tra of our matrices along Euclidean steps, allowing opti-
mization to step away from the manifold while still curving
about it.

1.1. Vanishing and Exploding Gradients

The issue of vanishing and exploding gradients as it per-
tains to the parameterization of neural networks can be illu-
minated by looking at the gradient back-propagation chain
through a network.

A neural network with n hidden layers has pre-activations

ai(hi−1) = Wi hi−1 + bi, i ∈ {2, · · · , n}

(1)

For notational convenience, we combine parameters Wi
and bi to form an afﬁne matrix θ. We can see that for
some loss function L at layer n, the derivative with respect
to parameters θi is:

∂L
∂θi

=

∂an+1
∂θi

∂L
∂an+1

(2)

(4)

The partial derivatives for the pre-activations can be de-
composed as follows:

∂ai+1
∂ai

where Di is the Jacobian corresponding to the activation
function, containing partial derivatives of the hidden units
at layer i + 1 with respect to the pre-activation inputs. Typ-
ically, D is diagonal. Following the above, the gradient in
equation 2 can be fully decomposed into a recursive chain
of matrix products:

In (Pascanu et al., 2013), it is shown that the 2-norm of

∂ai

is bounded by the product of the norms of the non-

linearity’s Jacobian and transition matrix at time t

where λDt and λWt are the largest singular values of the
non-linearity’s Jacobian Dt and the transition matrix Wt .
In RNNs, Wt is shared across time and can be simply de-
noted as W.

Equation 5 shows that the gradient can grow or shrink at
each layer depending on the gain of each layer’s linear
transformation W and the gain of the Jacobian D. The

time t to enable the possibility of vanishing gradients, typ-
ically for some large number of time steps T . The rate at
which a gradient (or forward signal) vanishes depends on
both the parameterization of the model and on the input
data. The parameterization may be conditioned by placing
appropriate constraints on W. It is worth keeping in mind
that the Jacobian D is typically contractive, thus tending
to be norm-reducing) and is also data-dependent, whereas
W can vary from being contractive to norm-preserving, to
expansive and applies the same gain on the forward signal
as on the back-propagated gradient signal.

2. Our Approach

Vanishing and exploding gradients can be controlled to a
large extent by controlling the maximum and minimum
gain of W. The maximum gain of a matrix W is given
by the spectral norm which is given by

||W||2 = max

(6)

(cid:34)

(cid:35)

.

||Wx||
||x||

By keeping our weight matrix W close to orthogonal, one
can ensure that it is close to a norm-preserving transfor-
mation (where the spectral norm is equal to one, but the
minimum gain is also one). One way to achieve this is via
a simple soft constraint or regularization term of the form:

(cid:88)

λ

i

||WT

i Wi − I||2.

(7)

However, it is possible to formulate a more direct pa-
rameterization or factorization for W which permits hard
bounds on the amount of expansion and contraction in-
duced by W. This can be achieved by simply parame-
terizing W according to its singular value decomposition,
which consists of the composition of orthogonal basis ma-
trices U and V with a diagonal spectral matrix S contain-
ing the singular values which are real and positive by deﬁ-

nition. We have

(8)

W = USVT .
Since the spectral norm or maximum gain of a matrix is
equal to its largest singular value, this decomposition al-
lows us to control the maximum gain or expansivity of the
weight matrix by controlling the magnitude of the largest
singular value. Similarly, the minimum gain or contractiv-
ity of a matrix can be obtained from the minimum singular
value.

We can keep the bases U and V orthogonal via geodesic
gradient descent along the set of weights that satisfy
UT U = I and VT V = I respectively. The submanifolds
that satisfy these constraints are called Stiefel manifolds.
We discuss how this is achieved in more detail below, then
discuss our construction for bounding the singular values.

During optimization, in order to maintain the orthogonality
of an orthogonally-initialized matrix M, i.e. where M =
U, M = V or M = W if so desired, we employ a Cayley
transformation of the update step onto the Stiefel manifold
of (semi-)orthogonal matrices, as in Nishimori (2005) and
Tagare (2011). Given an orthogonally-initialized parameter
matrix M and its Jacobian, G with respect to the objective
function, an update is performed as follows:

A = GMT − MGT
η
2

Mnew = M + (I +

A)−1(I −

A),

η
2

(9)

where A is a skew-symmetric matrix (that depends on the
Jacobian and on the parameter matrix) which is mapped to
an orthogonal matrix via a Cayley transform and η is the
learning rate.

While the update rule in (9) allows us to maintain an or-
thogonal hidden to hidden transition matrix W if desired,
we are interested in exploring the effect of stepping away
from the Stiefel manifold. As such, we parameterize the
transition matrix W in factorized form, as a singular value
decomposition with orthogonal bases U and V updated by
geodesic gradient descent using the Cayley transform ap-
proach above.

If W is an orthogonal matrix, the singular values in the
diagonal matrix S are all equal to one. However, in our
formulation we allow these singular values to deviate from
one and employ a sigmoidal parameterization to apply a
hard constraint on the maximum and minimum amount of
deviation. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne a margin m around 1
within which the singular values must lie. This is achieved
with the parameterization

si = 2m(σ(pi) − 0.5) + 1,

si ∈ {diag(S)}, m ∈ [0, 1].

(10)
The singular values are thus restricted to the range
[1 − m, 1 + m] and the underlying parameters pi are up-
dated freely via stochastic gradient descent. Note that this

parameterization strategy also has implications on the step
sizes that gradient descent based optimization will take
when updating the singular values – they tend to be smaller
compared to models with no margin constraining their val-
ues. Speciﬁcally, a singular value’s progression toward a
margin is slowed the closer it is to the margin. The sig-
moidal parameterization can also impart another effect on
the step size along the spectrum which needs to be ac-
counted for. Considering 10, the gradient backpropagation
of some loss L toward parameters pi is found as

dL
dpi

=

dsi
dpi

dL
dsi

= 2m

dσ(pi)
dpi

dL
dsi

.

(11)

From (11), it can be seen that the magnitude of the update
step for pi is scaled by the margin hyperparameter m. This
means for example that for margins less than one, the ef-
fective learning rate for the spectrum is reduced in propor-
tion to the margin. Consequently, we adjust the learning
rate along the spectrum to be independent of the margin by
renormalizing it by 2m.

This margin formulation both guarantees singular values
lie within a well deﬁned range and slows deviation from
orthogonality. Alternatively, one could enforce the orthog-
onality of U and V and impose a regularization term cor-
responding to a mean one Gaussian prior on these singu-
lar values. This encourages the weight matrix W to be
norm preserving with a controllable strength equivalent to
the variance of the Gaussian. We also explore this approach
further below.

3. Experiments

In this section, we explore hard and soft orthogonality con-
straints on factorized weight matrices for recurrent neural
network hidden to hidden transitions. With hard orthog-
onality constraints on U and V, we investigate the effect
of widening the spectral margin or bounds on convergence
and performance. Loosening these bounds allows increas-
ingly larger margins within which the transition matrix W
can deviate from orthogonality. We conﬁrm that orthogonal
initialization is useful as noted in Henaff et al. (2016), and
we show that although strict orthogonality guarantees sta-
ble gradient norm, loosening orthogonality constraints can
increase the rate of gradient descent convergence. We begin
our analyses on tasks that are designed to stress memory: a
sequence copying task and a basic addition task (Hochreiter
& Schmidhuber, 1997). We then move on to tasks on real
data that require models to capture long-range dependen-
cies: digit classiﬁcation based on sequential and permuted
MNIST vectors (Le et al., 2015; LeCun et al., 1998). Fi-
nally, we look at a basic language modeling task using the
Penn Treebank dataset (Marcus et al., 1993).

The copy and adding tasks, introduced by Hochreiter &

On orthogonality and learning RNNs with long term dependencies

Schmidhuber (1997), are synthetic benchmarks with patho-
logically hard long distance dependencies that require
long-term memory in models. The copy task consists of an
input sequence that must be remembered by the network,
followed by a series of blank inputs terminated by a de-
limiter that denotes the point at which the network must
begin to output a copy of the initial sequence. We use an
input sequence of T + 20 elements that begins with a sub-
sequence of 10 elements to copy, each containing a sym-
bol ai ∈ {a1 , ..., ap} out of p = 8 possible symbols. This
sub-sequence is followed by T − 1 elements of the blank
category a0 which is terminated at step T by a delimiter
symbol ap+1 and 10 more elements of the blank category.
The network must learn to remember the initial 10 element
sequence for T time steps and output it after receiving the
delimiter symbol.

The goal of the adding task is to add two numbers together
after a long delay. Each number is randomly picked at a
unique position in a sequence of length T . The sequence is
composed of T values sampled from a uniform distribution
in the range [0, 1), with each value paired with an indicator
value that identiﬁes the value as one of the two numbers to
remember (marked 1) or as a value to ignore (marked 0).
The two numbers are positioned randomly in the sequence,
the ﬁrst in the range [0, T
2 − 1] and the second in the range
[ T
2 , T − 1], where 0 marks the ﬁrst element. The network
must learn to identify and remember the two numbers and
output their sum.

In the sequential MNIST task from Le et al. (2015), MNIST
digits are ﬂattened into vectors that can be traversed se-
quentially by a recurrent neural network. The goal is to
classify the digit based on the sequential input of pixels.
The simple variant of this task is with a simple ﬂattening of
the image matrices; the harder variant of this task includes
a random permutation of the pixels in the input vector that
is determined once for an experiment. The latter formula-
tion introduces longer distance dependencies between pix-
els that must be interpreted by the classiﬁcation model.

The English Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset from Marcus
et al. (1993) is an annotated corpus of English sentences,
commonly used for benchmarking language models. We
employ a sequential character prediction task: given a sen-
tence, a recurrent neural network must predict the next
character at each step, from left to right. We use input se-
quences of variable length, with each sequence containing
one sentence. We model 49 characters including lower-
case letters (all strings are in lowercase), numbers, com-
mon punctuation, and an unknown character placeholder.
We use two subsets of the data in our experiments: in the
ﬁrst, we ﬁrst use 23% of the data with strings with up to
75 characters and in the second we include over 99% of the
dataset, picking strings with up to 300 characters.

3.1. Loosening Hard Orthogonality Constraints

In this section, we experimentally explore the effect of
loosening hard orthogonality constraints through loosening
the spectral margin deﬁned above for the hidden to hidden
transition matrix.

In all experiments, we employed RMSprop (Tieleman &
Hinton, 2012) when not using geodesic gradient descent.
We used minibatches of size 50 and for generated data (the
copy and adding tasks), we assumed an epoch length of 100
minibatches. We cautiously introduced gradient clipping at
magnitude 100 (unless stated otherwise) in all of our RNN
experiments although it may not be required and we consis-
tently applied a small weight decay of 0.0001. Unless oth-
erwise speciﬁed, we trained all simple recurrent neural net-
works with the hidden to hidden matrix factorization as in
(8) using geodesic gradient descent on the bases (learning
rate 10−6) and RMSprop on the other parameters (learning
rate 0.0001), using a tanh transition nonlinearity, and clip-
ping gradients of 100 magnitude. The neural network code
was built on the Theano framework (Theano Development
Team, 2016). When parameterizing a matrix in factorized
form, we apply the weight decay on the composite matrix
rather than on the factors in order to be consistent across
experiments. For MNIST and PTB, hyperparameter selec-
tion and early stopping were performed targeting the best
validation set accuracy, with results reported on the test set.

3.1.1. CONVERGENCE ON SYNTHETIC MEMORY TASKS

For different sequence lengths T of the copy and adding
tasks, we trained a factorized RNN with 128 hidden units
and various spectral margins m. For the copy task, we
used Elman networks without a transition non-linearity as
in Henaff et al. (2016). We also investigated the use of non-
linearities, as discussed below.

As shown in Figure 1 we see an increase in the rate of con-
vergence as we increase the spectral margin. This obser-
vation generally holds across the tested sequence lengths
(T = 200, T = 500, T = 1000, T = 10000); however,
large spectral margins hinder convergence on extremely
long sequence lengths. At sequence length T = 10000,
parameterizations with spectral margins larger than 0.001
converge slower than when using a margin of 0.001. In ad-
dition, the experiment without a margin failed to converge
on the longest sequence length. This follows the expected
pattern where stepping away from the Stiefel manifold may
help with gradient descent optimization but loosening or-
thogonality constraints can reduce the stability of signal
propagation through the network.

For the adding task, we trained a factorized RNN on
T = 1000 length sequences, using a ReLU activation func-
tion on the hidden to hidden transition matrix. The mean

with margin size; however, large margin sizes are ineffective at longer sequence lengths (T=10000, right).

squared error (MSE) is shown for different spectral mar-
gins in Figure 2. Testing spectral margins m = 0, m = 1,
m = 10, m = 100, and no margin, we ﬁnd that the models
with the purely orthogonal (m = 0) and the unconstrained
(no margin) transition matrices failed to begin converging
beyond baseline MSE within 2000 epochs.

the copy task is without a transition nonlinearity. Since the
copy task is purely a memory task, one may imagine that
a transition nonlinearity such as a tanh or ReLU may be
detrimental to the task as it can lose information. Thus,
we also tried a recent activation function that preserves
information, called an orthogonal permutation linear unit
(OPLU) (Chernodub & Nowicki, 2016). The OPLU pre-
serves norm, making a fully norm-preserving RNN pos-
sible. Interestingly, this activation function allowed us to
recover identical results on the copy task to those without a
nonlinearity for different spectral margins.

3.1.2. PERFORMANCE ON REAL DATA

Having conﬁrmed that an orthogonality constraint can neg-
atively impact convergence rate, we seek to investigate the
effect on model performance for tasks on real data. In Ta-
ble 1, we show the results of experiments on ordered and
permuted sequential MNIST classiﬁcation tasks and on the
PTB character prediction task.

For the sequential MNIST experiments, loss curves are
shown in Figure 3 and reveal an increased convergence rate
for larger spectral margins. We trained the factorized RNN
models with 128 hidden units for 120 epochs. We also
trained an LSTM with 128 hidden units (tanh activation) on
both tasks for 150 epochs, conﬁgured with peephole con-
nections, orthogonally initialized (and forget gate bias ini-
tialized to one), and trained with RMSprop (learning rate
0.0001, clipping gradients of magnitude 1).

For PTB character prediction, we evaluate results in terms
of bits per character (bpc) and prediction accuracy. Pre-
diction results are shown in 1 both for a subset of short
sequences (up to 75 characters; 23% of data) and for a sub-
set of long sequences (up to 300 characters; 99% of data).
We trained factorized RNN models with 512 hidden units
for 200 epochs with geodesic gradient descent on the bases
(learning rate 10−6) and RMSprop on the other parameters
(learning rate 0.001), using a tanh transition nonlinearity,
and clipping gradients of 30 magnitude. As a rough point of
reference, we also trained an LSTM with 512 hidden units
for each of the data subsets (conﬁgured as for MNIST).
On sequences up to 75 characters, LSTM performance was

Figure 2. Mean squared error (MSE) curves on the adding task
for different spectral margins m. A trivial solution of always out-
putting the same number has an expected baseline MSE of 0.167.

We found that nonlinearities such as a rectiﬁed linear unit
(ReLU) (Nair & Hinton, 2010) or hyperbolic tangent (tanh)
made the copy task far more difﬁcult to solve. Using tanh,
a short sequence length (T = 100) copy task required both
a soft constraint that encourages orthogonality and thou-
sands of epochs for training.
It is worth noting that in
the unitary evolution recurrent neural network of Arjovsky
et al. (2015), the non-linearity (referred to as the ”mod-
ReLU”) is actually initialized as an identity operation that
is free to deviate from identity during training. Further-
more, Henaff et al. (2016) derive a solution mechanism for
the copy task that drops the non-linearity from an RNN.
To explore this further, we experimented with a parametric
leaky ReLU activation function (PReLU) which introduces
a trainable slope α for negative valued inputs x , producing
f (x ) = max(x , 0) + αmin(x , 0) (He et al., 2015). Setting
the slope α to one would make the PReLU equivalent to
an identity function. We experimented with clamping α to
0.5, 0.7 or 1 in a factorized RNN with a spectral margin of
0.3 and found that only the model with α = 1 solved the
T = 1000 length copy task. We also experimented with a
trainable slope α, initialized to 0.7 and found that it con-
verges to 0.96, further suggesting the optimal solution for

It is
Bengio, 2010) or initializing the matrix as identity.
interesting to note that for the MNIST tasks, orthogonal
initialization appears useful while orthogonality constraints
appear mainly detrimental. This suggests that while or-
thogonality helps early training by stabilizing gradient ﬂow
across many time steps, orthogonality constraints may need
to be loosened on some tasks so as not to over-constrain the
model’s representational ability.

Curiously, larger margins and even models without sig-
moidal constraints on the spectrum (no margin) performed
well as long as they were initialized to be orthogonal, sug-
gesting that evolution away from orthogonality is not a se-
rious problem on MNIST. It is not surprising that orthog-
onality is useful for the MNIST tasks since they depend
on long distance signal propagation with a single output at
the end of the input sequence. On the other hand, charac-
ter prediction with PTB produces an output at every time
step. Constraining deviation from orthogonality proved
detrimental for short sentences and beneﬁcial when long
sentences were included. Furthermore, Glorot normal ini-
tialization did not perform worse than orthogonal initial-
ization for PTB. Since an output is generated for every
character in a sentence, short distance signal propagation is
possible. Thus it is possible that the RNN is ﬁrst learning
very local dependencies between neighbouring characters
and that given enough context, constraining deviation from
orthogonality can help force the network to learn longer
distance dependencies.

3.1.3. SPECTRAL AND GRADIENT EVOLUTION

It is interesting to note that even long sequence lengths
(T=1000) in the copy task can be solved efﬁciently with
rather large margins on the spectrum. In Figure 4 we look
at the gradient propagation of the loss from the last time
step in the network with respect to the hidden activations.
We can see that for a purely orthogonal parameterization of

zations on the sequential MNIST task (left) and the permuted se-
quential MNIST task (right). The spectral margin is denoted by
m; models with no margin have singular values that are directly
optimized with no constraints; Glorot refers to a factorized RNN
with no margin that is initialized with Glorot normal initialization.

limited by early stopping of training due to overﬁtting.

Interestingly, for both the ordered and permuted sequen-
tial MNIST tasks, models with a non-zero margin signiﬁ-
cantly outperform those that are constrained to have purely
orthogonal transition matrices (margin of zero). The best
results on both the ordered and sequential MNIST tasks
were yielded by models with a spectral margin of 0.1, at
94.10% accuracy and 91.44% accuracy, respectively. An
LSTM outperformed the RNNs in both tasks; nevertheless,
RNNs with hidden to hidden transitions initialized as or-
thogonal matrices performed admirably without a memory
component and without all of the additional parameters as-
sociated with gates. Indeed, orthogonally initialized RNNs
performed almost on par with the LSTM in the permuted
sequential MNIST task which presents longer distance de-
pendencies than the ordered task. Although the optimal
margin appears to be 0.1, RNNs with large margins per-
form almost identically to an RNN without a margin, as
long as the transition matrix is initialized as orthogonal.
On these tasks, orthogonal initialization appears to signif-
icantly outperform Glorot normal initialization (Glorot &

the transition matrix (when the margin is zero), the gradient
norm is preserved across time steps, as expected. We fur-
ther observe that with increasing margin size, the number
of update steps over which this norm preservation survives
decreases, though surprisingly not as quickly as expected.

ues of the transition matrix would help compensate for that
contraction. Indeed, (Saxe et al., 2013) describe this as a
possibly good regime for learning in deep neural networks.
That the model appears to evolve toward this regime sug-
gests that deviating from it may incur a cost. This is inter-
esting because the cost function cannot take into account
numerical issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients
(or forward signals); we do not know what could make this
deviation costly. That the transition matrix may be com-
pensating for the contraction of the tanh is supported by
further experiments: applying a 1.05 pre-activation gain ap-
pears to allow a model with a margin of 0 to nearly match
the top performance reached on both of the MNIST tasks.
Furthermore, when using the OPLU norm-preserving ac-
tivation function (Chernodub & Nowicki, 2016), we found
that orthogonally initialized models performed equally well
with all margins, achieving over 90% accuracy on the per-
muted sequential MNIST task. Unlike orthgonally initial-
ized models, the RNN on the bottom right of Figure 5
with Glorot normal initialized transition matrices begins
and ends with a wide singular spectrum. While there is
no clear positive shift in the distribution of singular values,
the mean value appears to very gradually increase for both
the ordered and permuted sequential MNIST tasks. If the
model is to be expected to positively shift singular values
to compensate for the contractivity of the tanh nonlinear-
ity, it is not doing so well for the Glorot-initialized case;
however, this may be due to the inefﬁciency of training as
a result of vanishing gradients, given that initialization.

3.2. Exploring Soft Orthogonality Constraints

Having established that it may indeed be useful to step
away from orthogonality, here we explore two forms of soft
constraints (rather than hard bounds as above) on hidden to
hidden transition matrix orthogonality. The ﬁrst is a simple
penalty that directly encourages a transition matrix W to
be orthogonal, of the form λ||WT W − I||2
2. This is simi-
lar to the orthogonality penalty introduced by Henaff et al.
(2016). In subﬁgures (A) and (B) of Figure 6, we explore
the effect of weakening this form of regularization. We
trained both a regular non-factorized RNN on the T = 200
copy task (A) and a factorized RNN with orthogonal bases
on the T = 500 copy task (B). For the regular RNN,
we had to reduce the learning rate to 10−5. Here again
we see that weakening the strength of the orthogonality-
encouraging penalty can increase convergence speed.

The second approach we explore replaces the sigmoidal
margin parameterization with a mean one Gaussian prior
on the singular values. In subﬁgures (C) and (D) of Figure
6, we visualize the accuracy on the length 200 copy task,
using geoSGD (learning rate 10−6) to keep U and V or-
thogonal and different strengths γ of a Gaussian prior with
mean one on the singular values si: γ (cid:80)
i ||si − 1||2. We

Figure 4. The norm of the gradient of the loss from the last time
step with respect to the hidden units at a given time step for a
length 220 RNN over 1000 update iterations for different margins.
Iterations are along the abscissa and time steps are denoted along
the ordinate. The ﬁrst column margins are: 0, 0.001, 0.01. The
second column margins are: 0.1, 1, no margin. Gradient norms
are normalized across the time dimension.

Although the deviation of singular values from one should
be slowed by the sigmoidal parameterizations, even param-
eterizations without a sigmoid (no margin) can be effec-
tively trained for all but the longest sequence lengths. This
suggests that the spectrum is not deviating far from orthog-
onality and that inputs to the hidden to hidden transitions
are mostly not aligned along the dimensions of greatest
expansion or contraction. We evaluated the spread of the
spectrum in all of our experiments and found that indeed,
singular values tend to stay well within their prescribed
bounds and only reach the margin when using a very large
learning rate that does not permit convergence. Further-
more, when transition matrices are initialized as orthogo-
nal, singular values remain near one throughout training
even without a sigmoidal margin for tasks that require long
term memory (copy, adding, sequential MNIST). On the
other hand, singular value distributions tend to drift away
from one for PTB character prediction which may help
explain why enforcing an orthogonality constraint can be
helpful for this task, when modeling long sequences. Inter-
estingly, singular values spread out less for longer sequence
lengths (nevertheless, the T=10000 copy task could not be
solved with no sigmoid on the spectrum).

We visualize the spread of singular values for differ-
ent model parameterizations on the permuted sequential
MNIST task in Figure 5. Curiously, we ﬁnd that the distri-
bution of singular values tends to shift upward to a mean of
approximately 1.05 on both the ordered and permuted se-
quential MNIST tasks. We note that in those experiments,
a tanh transition nonlinearity was used which is contractive
in both the forward signal pass and the gradient backward
pass. An upward shift in the distribution of singular val-

mean), minimum (red, bottom) and maximum (blue, top) values. All models are initialized with orthogonal hidden to hidden transition
matrices except for the model that yielded the plot on the bottom right, where Glorot normal initialization is used.

and that of a factorized RNN in (B). A mean one Gaussian prior is applied to the singular values of a factorized RNN in (C) and (D); the

trained these experiments with regular SGD on the spec-
trum and other non-orthogonal parameter matrices, using a
10−5 learning rate. We see that strong priors lead to slow
convergence. Loosening the strength of the prior makes
the optimization more efﬁcient. Furthermore, we compare
a direct parameterization of the spectrum (no sigmoid) in
(C) with a sigmoidal parameterization, using a large margin
of 1 in (D). Without the sigmoidal parameterization, opti-
mization quickly becomes unstable; on the other hand, the
optimization also becomes unstable if the prior is removed
completely in the sigmoidal formulation (margin 1). These
results further motivate the idea that parameterizations that
deviate from orthogonality may perform better than purely
orthogonal ones, as long as they are sufﬁciently constrained
to avoid instability during training.

4. Conclusions

We have explored a number of methods for controlling
the expansivity of gradients during backpropagation based

learning in RNNs through manipulating orthogonality con-
straints and regularization on weight matrices. Our exper-
iments indicate that while orthogonal initialization may be
beneﬁcial, maintaining hard constraints on orthogonality
can be detrimental. Indeed, moving away from hard con-
straints on matrix orthogonality can help improve optimiza-
tion convergence rate and model performance. However,
we also observe with synthetic tasks that relaxing regular-
ization which encourages the spectral norms of weight ma-
trices to be close to one too much, or allowing bounds on
the spectral norms of weight matrices to be too wide, can
reverse these gains and may lead to unstable optimization.
