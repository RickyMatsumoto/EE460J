Appendix A

In this appendix, we collect relevant information on the
Wasserstein metric and Wasserstein barycenter problem,
which were introduced in Section 2 in the paper. For any
Borel map g : Θ → Θ and probability measure G on
Θ, the push-forward measure of G through g, denoted by
g#G, is deﬁned by the condition that
f (y)d(g#G)(y) =

trices. The optimal T ∈ Π(G, G(cid:48)) in optimization problem
(1) is called the optimal coupling of G and G(cid:48), representing
the optimal transport between these two measures. When
k = k(cid:48), the complexity of best algorithms for ﬁnding the
optimal transport is O(k3 log k). Currently, (Cuturi, 2013)
proposed a regularized version of (1) based on Sinkhorn
distance where the complexity of ﬁnding an approximation
of the optimal transport is O(k2). Due to its favorably fast

computation, throughout the paper we shall utilize Cuturi’s
algorithm to compute the Wasserstein distance between G
and G(cid:48) as well as their optimal transport in (1).

Wasserstein barycenter As introduced in Section 2.2 in
the paper, for any probability measures P1, P2, . . . , PN ∈
P2(Θ), their Wasserstein barycenter P N,λ is such that

P N,λ = arg min
P ∈P2(Θ)

where λ ∈ ∆N denote weights associated with
P1, . . . , PN . According to (Agueh and Carlier, 2011),
PN,λ can be obtained as a solution to so-called multi-
marginal optimal transporation problem. In fact, if we de-
note T 1
k as the measure preseving map from P1 to Pk, i.e.,
Pk = T 1

P N,λ =

Unfortunately, the forms of the maps T 1
k are analytically in-
tractable, especially if no special constraints on P1, . . . , PN
are imposed.

Recently, (Anderes et al., 2015) studied the Wasserstein
barycenters P N,λ when P1, P2, . . . , PN are ﬁnite discrete

measures and λ =

. They demonstrate

the following sharp result (cf. Theorem 2 in (Anderes et al.,
2015)) regarding the number of atoms of P N,λ
Theorem A.1. There exists a Wasserstein barycenter P N,λ

such that supp(P N,λ) ≤

si − N + 1.

Therefore, when P1, . . . , PN are indeed ﬁnite discrete mea-
sures and the weights are uniform, the problem of ﬁnd-
ing Wasserstein barycenter P N,λ over the (computationally
large) space P2(Θ) is reduced to a search over a smaller

space Ol(Θ) where l =

si − N + 1.

Appendix B

In this appendix, we provide proofs for the remaining re-
sults in the paper. We start by giving a proof for the tran-

sition from multilevel Wasserstein means objective func-
tion to objective function (4) in Section 3.1 in the paper.
All the notations in this appendix are similar to those in
the main text. For each closed subset S ⊂ P2(Θ), denote
the Voronoi region generated by S on the space P2(Θ) by
the collection of subsets {VP }P ∈S , where VP := {Q ∈
P2(Θ) : W 2
2 (Q, G)}. We deﬁne the
projection mapping πS as: πS : P2(Θ) → S where
πS (Q) = P as Q ∈ VP . Note that, for any P1, P2 ∈ S
such that VP1 and VP2 share the boundary, the values of πS
at the elements in that boundary can be chosen to be either
P1 or P2. Now, we start with the following useful lemmas.

where the inﬁmum in the ﬁrst equality ranges over all π ∈
Π(Q, πS #Q).

On the other hand, let g : P2(Θ) → P2(Θ) × S such that
g(P ) = (P, πS (P )) for all P ∈ P2(Θ). Additionally, let
µπS = g#Q, the push-forward measure of Q under map-
ping g. It is clear that µπS is a coupling between Q and
πS #Q. Under this construction, we obtain for any X ∼ Q
that

where the last inequality is due to Lemma B.1 and the inte-
grations in the ﬁrst two terms range over P2(Θ) × S while

achieve the conclusion of the lemma.

Equipped with Lemma B.1 and Lemma B.2, we are ready
to establish the equivalence between multilevel Wasserstein
means objective function (5) and objective function (4) in
Section 3.1 in the main text.

where the second equality in the above display is due to

πH #Q is a discrete probability measure in P2(P2(Θ))
with exactly M support points. Since the inequality in the
above display holds for any (cid:15), it implies that B ≥ A. On
the other hand, from the formation of A, for any (cid:15) > 0, we
also can ﬁnd H(cid:48) ∈ EM (P2(Θ)) such that

Therefore, it means that A ≥ B. We achieve the conclu-
sion of the lemma.

this theorem, it is sufﬁcient to demonstrate for any t ≥ 0
that

f (G(t+1), H (t+1)) ≤ f (G(t), H (t)).

This inequality comes directly from f (G(t+1), H (t)) ≤
f (G(t), H (t)), which is due to the Wasserstein barycen-
ter problems to obtain G(t+1)
for 1 ≤ j ≤ m, and
f (G(t+1), H (t+1)) ≤ f (G(t+1), H (t)), which is due
to the optimization steps to achieve elements H (t+1)
of
H (t+1) as 1 ≤ u ≤ M . As a consequence, we achieve
the conclusion of the theorem.

Okj (Θ) and H ∈ EM (P(Θ)) such that

f (G, H)1/2 ≤ L1/2

Indeed, for each ﬁxed
ward application of Lemma B.3.
(G1, . . . , Gm) the inﬁmum w.r.t to H in C leads to the
same inﬁmum w.r.t to H in D, according to Lemma B.3.
Now, by taking the inﬁmum w.r.t to (G1, . . . , Gm) on both
sides, we achieve the conclusion of the proposition.

In the remainder of the Supplement, we present the proofs
for all remaining theorems stated in the main text.

sequence, A((cid:15)) is also a compact set. For any (G, H) ∈
A((cid:15)), by the deﬁnition of F we would have f (G, H) >
f (G0, H0) for any (G0, H0) ∈ F. Since A((cid:15)) is compact,

Now, similar to Theorem 3.1 in the main text, we also have
the following theoretical guarantee regarding the behavior
of Algorithm 2 as follows

Thus, it leads to

Appendix D

In this appendix, we offer details on the data generation
processes utilized in the simulation studies presented in
Section 5 in the main text. The notions of m, n, d, M are
given in the main text. Let Ki be the number of supporting
atoms of Hi and kj the number of atoms of Gj. For any
d ≥ 1, we denote 1d to be d dimensional vector with all
components to be 1. Furthermore, Id is an identity matrix
with d dimensions.

For the case of non-constrained variances, the variance to

Three-stage K-means First, we estimate Gj for each
group 1 ≤ j ≤ m by using K-means algorithm with kj
clusters. Then, we cluster labels using K-means algorithm
with M clusters based on the collection of all atoms of Gjs.
Finally, we estimate the atoms of each Hi via K-means
algorithm with exactly L clusters for each group of local
atoms. Here, L is some given threshold being used in Algo-
rithm 1 in Section 3.1 in the main text to speed up the com-
putation (see ﬁnal remark regarding Algorithm 1 in Section
3.1). The three-stage K-means algorithm is summarized in
Algorithm 3.

Multilevel Wasserstein means setting The global clus-
ters are generated as follows:
