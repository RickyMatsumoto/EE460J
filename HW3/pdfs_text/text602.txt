A. Algorithm for Global BPTT Computation

As mentioned in Section 4 of main paper, the intricate relational and temporal dependencies between data points in our
setting limits our ability to efﬁciently train by decomposing events into independent sequences. To address this challenge,
we design an efﬁcient Global BPTT algorithm presented below. During each step of training, we build computational
graph using consecutive events in the sliding window of a ﬁxed size. We then move sliding window further and train till
the end of timeline in similar fashion which allows to capture dependencies across batches while retaining efﬁciency.

Know-Evolve. Both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 demonstrate that the computational graph for each mini-batch will be
signiﬁcantly different due to high variations in the interactions happening in each window. To facilitate efﬁcient training
over dynamic computational graph setting, we leverage on graph embedding framework proposed in (Dai et al., 2016a)
that allows to learn over graph structure where the objective function may potentially have different computational graph
for each batch. We use Adam Optimizer with gradient clipping for making parameter updates. Using grid search method
across hyper-parameters, we set mini-batch size = 200, weight scale = 0.1 and learning rate = 0.0005 for all datasets. We
used zero initialization for our entity embeddings which is reasonable choice for dynamically evolving entities.

Competitors. We implemented all the reported baselines in Tensorﬂow and evaluated all methods uniformly. For each
method, we use grid search on hyper-parameters and embedding size and chose the ones providing best performance
in respective methods. All the baseline methods are trained using contrastive max-margin objective function described
in (Socher et al., 2013). We use Adagrad optimization provided in Tensorﬂow for optimizing this objective function. We
randomly initialize entity embeddings as typically done for these models.

D. Parameter Complexity Analysis

We report the dimensionality of embeddings and the resulting number of parameters of various models. Table 3 illustrates
that Know-Evolve is signiﬁcantly efﬁcient in the number of parameters compared to Neural Tensor Network while being
highly expressive as demonstrated by its prediction performance in Section 5 of main paper. The overall number of
parameters for different dataset conﬁgurations are comparable to the simpler relational models in order of magnitude.

E. Exploratory Analysis

E.1. Temporal Reasoning

We have shown that our model can achieve high accuracy when predicting a future event triplet or the time of event. Here,
we present two case studies to demonstrate the ability of evolutionary knowledge network to perform superior reasoning
across multiple relationships in the knowledge graphs.

CASE STUDY I: ENEMY’S FRIENDS IS AN ENEMY

We concentrate on the prediction of a quadruplet
(Cairo,Assault,Croatia,July 5,2015) available in test set.
This event relates to the news report of an assault on a Croa-
tion prisoner in Cairo on July 6 2015. Our model gives
rank-1 to the object entity Croatia while the baselines did
not predict them well (rank > 250).

We ﬁrst consider relationship characteristics for Cairo and
Croatia. In the current train span, there are 142 nodes with
which Cairo was involved in a relationship as a subject (to-
tal of 1369 events) and Croatia was involved in a relation-
ship as an object (total of 1037 events). As a subject, Cairo
was involved in an assault relationship only 59 times while
as an object, Croatia was involved in assault only 5 times.
As mentioned earlier, there was no direct edge present be-
tween Cairo and Croatia with relationship type assault.

While the conventional reasoning methods consider static
interactions of entities in a speciﬁc relationship space, they
fail to account for the temporal effect on certain relation-
ships and dynamic evolution of entity embeddings. We be-
lieve that our method is able to capture this multi-faceted
knowledge that helps to reason better than the competitors for the above case.

Figure 1. Relationship graph for Cairo and Croatia. Dotted arrow
shows the predicted edge. Direction of the arrow is from subject
to object entity.

Temporal Effect. It is observed in the dataset that many entities were involved more in negative relationships in the last
month of training data as compared to earlier months of the year. Further, a lot of assault activities on foreign prisoners
were being reported in Cairo starting from May 2015. Our model successfully captures this increased intensity of such
events in recent past. The interesting observation is that overall, Cairo has been involved in much higher number of positive
relationships as compared to negative ones and that would lead conventional baselines to use that path to reason for new
entity – instead our model tries to capture effect of most recent events.

Dynamic Knowledge Evolution. It can be seen from the dataset that Cairo got associated with more and more negative
events towards the mid of year 2015 as compared to start of the year where it was mostly involved in positive and coop-
eration relationships. While this was not very prominent in case of Croatia, it still showed some change in the type of
relationships over time. There were multiple instances where Cairo was involved in a negative relationship with a node
which in turn had positive relationship with Croatia. This signiﬁes that the features of the two entities were jointly and
non-linearly evolving with the features of the third entity in different relationship spaces.

Below we provide reference links for the actual event news related to the edges in Figure 1.

CASE STUDY II: COMMON ENEMY FORGES FRIENDSHIP

We concentrate on the prediction of a quadruplet (Colom-
bia,Engage in Material Cooperation,Ottawa,July 2 2015)
available in test set. This event relates to the news report
of concerns over a military deal between Colombia and
Canada on July 2 2015 and reported in Ottawa Citizen. Our
model gives rank-1 to the object entity Ottawa while the
other baselines do not predict well (rank > 250). The
above test event is a new relationship and was never seen in
training.

As before, we consider relationship characteristics between
In the current train span, there
Colombia and Ottawa.
are 165 nodes for which Colombia was involved in a
relationship with that node as a subject (total of 1604
events) and on the other hand, Ottawa was involved in
a relationship with those nodes as an object total of 733
events). As a subject, Colombia was involved in a cooper-
ation relationship 71 times while as an object, Ottawa was
involved in cooperation 24 times.

Figure 2. Relationship graph for Columbia and Ottawa. Dotted
arrow shows the predicted edge. Direction of the arrow is from
subject to object entity.

Temporal Effect. It is observed in the dataset that Colombia has been involved in hundreds of relationships with Venezuela
(which is natural as they are neighbors). These relationships range across the spectrum from being as negative as “ﬁght”
to being as positive as “engagement in material cooperation”. But more recently in the training set (i.e after May 2015),
the two countries have been mostly involved in positive relationships. Venezuela in turn has only been in cooperation
relationship with Ottawa (Canada). Thus, it can be inferred that Colombia is affected by its more recent interaction with
its neighbors while forming relationship with Canada.

Dynamic Knowledge Evolution. Overall it was observed that Colombia got involved in more positive relationships
towards the end of training period as compared to the start. This can be attributed to events like economic growth, better
living standards, better relations getting developed which has led to evolution of Colombia’s features in positive direction.
The features for Ottawa (Canada) have continued to evolve in positive direction as it has been involved very less in negative
relationships.

More interesting events exemplifying mutual evolution were also observed. In these cases, the relationship between Colom-
bia and third entity were negative but following that relationship in time, the third entity forged a positive relationship with
Ottawa (Canada). One can infer that it was in Colombia’s strategic interest to forge cooperation (positive relation) with
Ottawa so as to counter its relationship with third entity. Below we provide reference links for the actual event news related
to the edges in Figure 2.

E.2. Sliding Window Training Experiment

Unlike competitors, the entity embeddings in our model get updated after every event in the test, but the model parameters
remain unchanged after training. To balance out the advantage that this may give to our method, we explore the use
of sliding window training paradigm for baselines: We train on ﬁrst six months of dataset and evaluate on the ﬁrst test
window. Next we throw away as many days (2 weeks) from start of train set as found in test set and incorporate the test
data into training. We retrain the model using previously learned parameters as warm start. This can effectively aid the
baselines to adapt to the evolving knowledge over time. Figure 3 shows that the sliding window training contributes to
stable performance of baselines across the time window (i.e.the temporal deterioration is no longer observed signiﬁcantly
for baselines). But the overall performance of our method still surpasses all the competitors.

E.3. Recurrent Facts vs. New facts

One fundamental distinction in our multi-relational setting is the existence of recurrence relations which is not the case for
traditional knowledge graphs. To that end, we compare our method with the best performing competitor - NTN on two
different testing setups: 1.) Only Recurrent Facts in test set 2.) Only New facts in test set. We perform this experiment on
GDELT-500 data. We call a test fact “new” if it was never seen in training. As one can expect, the proportion of new facts
will increase as we move further in time. In our case, it ranges from 40%-60% of the total number of events in a speciﬁc
test window. Figure 4 demonstrates that our method performs consistently and signiﬁcantly better in both cases.
