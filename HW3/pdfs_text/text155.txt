A. Naive derivation of the Fisher information

matrix of the Poisson gamma belief
network

gamma belief network (PGBN), expressed as

With D (z) = G(z)−1, Q (z) = 0, and the block-diagonal
Fisher information matrix (FIM) G(z) in (9), it is straight
[D (z) + Q (z)] is non-zero only in the

ϕk-related block I (ϕk) in (10). Therefore, we focus on
this block and have

Deep Latent Dirichlet Allocation with TLASGR MCMC

E. Visualizations of the extracted topics and

networks

In the following, we provide some example results, ob-
tained using DLDA where [K1, K2, K3] = [128, 64, 32]
and η(l) = 1/Kl for the lth layer, on extracting multilayer
representations/topics from both the RCV1 and Wiki cor-
pora. Clearly interpretable results, which are similar to those
reported in Zhou et al. (2016a) and hence omitted here for
brevity, are also extracted from the 20Newsgroups corpus.

E.1. RCV1

Following the visualization techniques in Zhou et al.
(2016a), we plot 54 example topics of layer one in Fig-
ure 4, the top 30 topics of layer two in Figure 5, and the top
30 topics of layer three in Figure 6. Figure 4 clearly shows
that the topics of layer one are very speciﬁc. For example,
topics 41, 71 and 62 in the ﬁrst row are about “Germany,”
“Polish,” and “France,” respectively; topics 53 and 54 in
the second row are about “airline” and “European union,”
respectively; and topics 85 and 36 in the third row are about
“ship & island” and “comput & techn,” respectively. By con-
trast, the topics of layers two and three, shown in Figures
5 and 6, respectively, are increasingly more general. Such
topics can be better interpreted via the following informative
tree structured visualizations. Note that a tree deﬁned in this
paper allows a child node of a layer to be connected to more
than one parent node of the adjacent higher layer.

Shown in Figure 7 is a [10, 3, 1] tree rooted at node 4 of the
top layer on “bonds, rates, & credit markets.” Apparently,
the topics become more and more speciﬁc when moving
from top to bottom following the branches. For example,
the root node splits into three nodes from layers three to two,
which focus differently on “treasury bill,” “dollar rate,” and
“bond, credit, & debt,” respectively. When moving from
layers two to one, all three topics in layer two splits into
multiple ones that is clearly more speciﬁc. For example,
topics 1, 17, and 87 are about “months,” “loan & credit,”
and “bond & pay,” respectively.

Shown in Figure 8 is another analogous tree rooted at node
24 of layer three. It is clear that, as the nodes of this tree,
topics 55, 38, 34, and 30 of layer two are mainly about “Ger-
many,” “France,” “airline,” and “labor union,” respectively.
Moreover, these four topics at layer two are all connected
to topic 8 of layer one, which is very speciﬁc on “ofﬁce
meetings.”

To understand the relationships and distinctions between dif-
ferent trees, we construct subnetworks as shown in Figures
9-10. Figure 9 clearly shows that all three trees, rooted at
nodes 16, 10, and 17 of layer three, respectively, are highly
related to topic 3 of layer two on “low & expect”. However,
the two trees rooted at node 10 and 17, respectively, both

have their own speciﬁcities. For example, topic 52 of layer
two on “wall street,” is unique to node 10 of layer three,
and topic 35 of layer two on “India” is unique to node 17
of layer three. Similar phenomena can also be observed
from another subnetwork on “China,” shown in Figure 10,
where both nodes of the top layer are connected to topic 19
of layer two on “corp & techn,” topic 36 on “China,” and
topic 12 on “proﬁt & expect.” Though related to each other,
the tree rooted at node 18 of the top layer is also strongly
connected to topic 31 on “project” and topic 34 on “airline,”
whereas the other one focuses differently on topic 49 on
“car & Korea” and topic 44 on “growth rate”.

E.2. Wiki

What follows are analogous ﬁgures illustrating some inter-
pretable topics extracted from Wiki.

Figures 11-13 show the top example topics at layers one,
two, and three, respectively. It is obvious that topics of
layer one are speciﬁc, such as topic 31 on “university &
research,” topic 72 on “news, magazine, & times,” topic
83 on “military & army,” topic 74 on “police, crime &
prison,” topic 75 on “birds & species,” topic 36 on “British
& England,” and so on. By contrast, when going to higher
layers, topics become more general, as shown in Figures
12 and 13. To better illustrate topics of higher layers, we
explicitly show their hierarchical structures via the following
trees and subnetworks.

Figure 14 shows a tree rooted at node 1 of layer three on
“music & song,” whose topics at layer two are about “song &
band” and “music, piano, & theatre,” respectively. Figure 15
demonstrates another tree consisting of topic 9 of layer two
on “London & British,” topic 50 on “church & Catholic,”
and topic 25 on “king & prince,” which is mainly about
“United Kingdom.” Given in Figure 16 is another tree on
“art & museum,” where the left side is about “art” while the
right is on “history & building.” These trees are all clearly
interpretable.

In the subnetwork shown in Figure 17, all three trees are
related to topic 9 of layer two on “London, British, & Sir.”
But they focus differently on topic 16 of layer two on “Irish
Americans,” topic 24 on “life, birth, education, career, fam-
ily, & death,” and topic 25 on “king & prince,” respectively.
Similar phenomena can also be observed in Figure 18. Both
trees are related to topic 52 of layer two on “ship” and
topic 49 on “air,” but the left one is about various means
of transportation and communication while the right one
is about various components of “war.” Figure 19 shows
another subnetwork on “team & race,” where three trees,
all include topic 6 of layer two, focus differently on “goals,
clubs, & league,” “world cup,” and “rank, ﬁrst, second, &
third,” respectively.

non-negligible weights to node 4 of the top layer, taken from the full [128, 64, 32] DLDA network trained with TLASGR MCMC on the
794,414 training documents of the RCV1 corpus, with η(l) = 1/Kl for the lth layer. A line from node k at layer l to node k(cid:48) at layer
l − 1 indicates that Φ(l)(k(cid:48), k) > 5/Kl−1, with the width of the line proportional to
Φ(l)(k(cid:48), k). For each node, the rank (in terms of
popularity) at the corresponding layer and the top 12 words of the corresponding topic are displayed inside the text box, where the text
font size monotonically decreases as the popularity of the node decreases, and the outside border of the text box is colored as orange, blue,
