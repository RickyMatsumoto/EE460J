paper. Before providing the actual proofs, we present some useful propositions
that will help the reader understand the material that follows.

lowing the Binomial distribution with number of trials as n and success ratio as
pn, denoted by Binomial(n, pn), such that n → ∞, pn → 0 and npn → λ > 0.

Proof of proposition (1)
in the main paper:
Assume that z(t) is a realization of the BDFP (Z(t)) over the ﬁnite interval
[0, T ], T > 0 and we write (z(t))0≤t≤T . With probability one the sample path
(z(t))0≤t≤T will only contain a ﬁnite number of jump events, each of which is
either a birth or a death event. We write B and Q to denote the set of the
features created or turned oﬀ by birth or death events respectively. We denote
as t1, . . . , tJ the times when the chain jumps, where J = |B| + |Q|.

The probability of observing a sample (z(t))0≤t≤T can be written as the
product of three factors; the probability of the initial state, the probability of
each jump (event) and the probability of the interarrival times between the
events. More speciﬁcally,

• Probability of the initial state at time t = 0:

At time t = 0, the feature allocation z(0) follows an IBP distribution.

where Kz(0)+ and Hz(0) are the number of total and distinct nonzero
features correspondingly in state z(0) and mk is the number of objects
that possess feature k.

• Probability of all the interarrival times between events:

The probability that the chain will not jump in the interval [tl, tl+1] can
be derived as follows, by dividing the time from tl to tl+1 into k intervals
of duration tl+1−tl

, and letting k → ∞:

where we wrote q(t) = qz(tl) and we also considered that the rate qz(tl)
is constant in the interval tl+1 − tl. The interarrival times in [0, T ] are
independent of each other, so the probability of all the interarrival times
is a product as follows:

where t0 = 0 and t|B|+|Q|+1 = T . Note that the above product includes
the probability of not transiting from the last jump time to T .

• Probability of all the events taking place during the interval [0, T ]:

The probability density that the chain jumps at time tl to a new state
is qz(tl−)z(tl), where tl− denotes an inﬁnitesimal time prior to tl. The
probability density of all the events taking place is:

To compute the probability of the path we take the product of Equations (1),(2)
and (3).

Proof of corollary (1)
The IBP is deﬁned as the limit of the corresponding distribution over matrices
with M columns as M → ∞. The ﬁnite model, which gives the IBP in the limit
as M → ∞ (Griﬃths & Ghahramani, 2011) is

Proof of proposition (4)
For what follows, we use NB(δ) to denote the number of birth events (actual
appearance of a feature with at least one member in it) that is NB(δ) = |{B =
{fk} : tk
n=1 znk(t) ≥ 1}| and NF (δ) to denote the number of feature
events tb at time interval δ, that is NF (δ) = |{F = {fk} : tk
b ∈ δ}|. Note here
the diﬀerence between a birth and a feature event. Not all feature events are
birth events.

where, based on Equation (12) in the main paper, ωk ∼ Beta(cid:0) R
over, P (NB(δ) = 1, ωk|NF (δ) = 1) is the probability that at time interval
δ at least one object out of N grants membership of the feature given that
only one feature is created at the interval δ, i.e

P (NB(δ) = 1, ωk|NF (δ) = 1) = P (n ≥ 1) = 1 − P (n < 1) = 1 − (1 − ωk)N

where we used the fact that P (n ≤ m) is given by the Binomial cumulative

In order to compute the birth rate at [t, t+δ] we need to compute the probability

The number of actual births given the number of features present follows a
Binomial distribution, i.e. NB(δ)|NF (δ) ∼ Binomial(NB(δ); NF (δ), π). Since
NF (δ) → Kδ → ∞ and π → 0 as K → ∞, following Proposition (1), this
distribution can be approximated by

NB(δ)|NF (δ) ∼ Poisson(NB(δ); πKδ), K → ∞

(10)

Based on Equation (10), Equation (9) now becomes

P (NB(δ) = 1) = δRHN e−δRHN δ→0= δRHN

(13)

If we divide the result by δ, then the resulting rate is equal to the overall birth
rate RHN in BDFP. The probability of only one feature out of the NF dying in
the time interval δ is trivial NF (δ) R
α equal to the death rate in BDF process.
We assumed that the probability of observing more than one events in δ → 0 is
negligible.

Proof of proposition (5)
In the ﬁnite model, at any t ∈ T, the constrained projection is computed as an
integral over the space deﬁned by the updated set of constraints t − tω < tb < t,
0 < tω < ∞ and 0 < tb < T which can be summarised as t − tω < tb < t and

The exponential terms add a dependency on the index t ∈ T. This is a result
of constraining tb ∈ [0, T ]; the number of features present near the origin t = 0
is smaller than the number of features present later in time, since no features
are allowed to be born in tb < 0. This eﬀect diminishes as t (cid:29) 1
D since then
e−Dt → 0 and νt(dωdx) coincides with the restricted projection in the inﬁnite
case, i.e. νt(dωdx) = ρ(dω) µ0(dx)

X νt(dωdx) = K(−te−Dt + 1−e−Dt

In the same fashion, in the ﬁnite model, the expected number of features
present at any t ∈ T is (cid:82) 1
D ). Again, for

D and K → ∞ in
the inﬁnite case. This is conﬁrmed in Figure 1(a). It takes some time until the
empirical mean number of features converges to the true expected value under
the inﬁnite model. In order to make sure that at any random time point in the
range considered the process has IBP marginals, we have to make sure that the
expected number of features at any time is equal to the true expected value,
that is K
R . The discussion above ensures this considering the process at
t (cid:29) 1
D , where the D is the death rate. In this case, we only allow data to live
at the time range where IBP marginals are satisﬁed.

D = Kα

3 Posterior Simulation

The BDF process is a continuous-time Markov process and use of the forward-
backward algorithm would facilitate inference. However, the exponentially large
space of feature allocations makes inference hard. However, the equivalent BEP
simpliﬁes inference by allowing the application of a simple, eﬃcient Gibbs sam-
pling approach. For what follows, we present the posterior distributions for the
linear-Gaussian likelihood model in Equation 15 and presented in Figure 3.

Likelihood term p(Y|S, tb, tw, A, σ(cid:15)) Given all the unknown parameters,
the computation of the likelihood is straightforward. More precisely, given the
values of S, tb and tw the computation of the feature allocation matrices Zt for
t = 1, . . . , L is deterministic, as presented earlier, and as such, observing the
data matrix Yt is equal in distribution to observing matrix Yt − ZtA for which

Sample the noise standard deviation σ(cid:15) We put a Gamma prior over

hyperparameters. The posterior over the precision is then,

p(τ(cid:15)|Y, S, tb, tw, A) ∝ p(Y|S, tb, tw, A, τ(cid:15))p(τ(cid:15)|a(cid:15), β(cid:15))

The Gamma prior is conjugate to the Gaussian likelihood and thus, the condi-
tional posterior is a Gamma distribution too. More precisely, the posterior has

We only need to consider Snk ∈ {0, 1}, so we evaluate the right hand side for
Snk = 0 and Snk = 1, normalize, and sample Snk from the resulting Bernoulli
posterior.

3.1 Getting it right

To validate our sampling alorithm for BEP we follow the joint distribution
testing methodology of Geweke (2004). There are two ways to sample from
the joint distribution, P (Y, θ) over parameters θ = {R, ω, S, tb, tw, A, α, σ(cid:15)},
and data, Y deﬁned by a probabilistic model such as BEP. The ﬁrst we will
refer to as “marginal-conditional” sampling, shown in Algorithm 1. Both steps
here are straightforward: sampling from the prior followed by sampling from
the likelihood model. The second way, referred to as “successive-conditional”
sampling is shown in Algorithm 2, where Q represents a single (or multiple)
iteration(s) of our MCMC sampler. To validate our sampler we can then check,
either informally or using hypothesis tests, whether the samples drawn from the
joint P (Y, θ) in these two diﬀerent ways appear to have come from the same
distribution.

We apply this method to our sampler with just N = 10, D = 2 and |F| = 5,
two time points and all hyperparameters ﬁxed as follows: For the shape and scale
of α we set κα = 4, θα = 1, for the shape and rate of (cid:15) we set α(cid:15) = 2, β(cid:15) = 2,
for the shape and scale of R we chose κR = 4, θR = 1 and ﬁnally for the mean
and standard deviation of A we set µA = 0, σA = 1.

We draw 80K samples using both the marginal-conditional and successive-
conditional procedures. We look at various characteristics of the samples, in-
cluding the number of features at every time point, the mean of the factor
loading matrix A.

The distribution of the number of features under the successive-conditional
sampler matches that under the marginal-conditional sampler almost perfectly
as shown in Figure 2. Both the histogram and the quantile-quantile plot show
the similarity of the two distributions, with the straight line in the later indi-
cating an almost perfect match. The deviation from a straight line in the upper

9

corner of the qq-plot is a result of there being fewer samples available to esti-
mate these quantiles accurately. Under the successive-conditional sampler the
average number of features is 0.85, 0.95 for the two locations while under the
marginal-conditional is 0.83, 0.96 respectively with standard deviations 0.91,
1.01 and 0.92, 1.02 respectively: a hypothesis test did not reject the null hy-
pothesis that the means of the two distributions are equal. While this cannot
completely guarantee correctness of the algorithm and code, 80K samples is a
large number for such a small model and thus provides strong evidence that our
algorithm is correct. Figure 3 provides the same evidence.

location. Respectively for the second time location in column (b). Figure in the
last row show the qq-plots of the two empirical distributions for the two time

of our MCMC sampler for the ﬁnite model.

analysis, we provide here further experiments on synthetic dataset.

4.1 Synthetic dataset

We ﬁrst explored the ability of our model to recover underlying structure us-
ing synthetic data. We generated observations Yt from the BEP at 7 dis-
tinct time points, t = 1, 2, . . . , 7. More speciﬁcally, we assumed N = 20 data-
points and 4 features with birth times, tb = [0.1, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2] and life spans
tw = [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8]. We also assumed a potential matrix S and derived the
feature allocation matrices Zt as determined by the BEP and shown in Figure 4.
We used the four 6 × 6 images shown in Figure 4 (middle row, left) as features
and collected them to construct the feature loading matrix A of size 4 × 36.
Each row of this matrix corresponds to one of the 4 features. The synthetic
data at each time point is then generated by superimposing the images using
the linear Gaussian likelihood, i.e. Yt = ZtA + (cid:15), where (cid:15) is the noise term
which we take as Gaussian with standard deviation 0.5.

We ran both models, that is the BEP and a set of 7 independent IBP models
(one at each time location). To evaluate predictive performance, we held out
10% of the data (elements in each Yt). For inference, we ran the BEP sampler
derived in Section 3 for 1000 MCMC iterations, which appeared suﬃcient for
burnin. The total number of features is KT = 12, where we took K = 6 and T =
2. For the independent IBP model, we considered the same Gaussian likelihood

as for the BEP but with independent A and noise variance at each location. The
quantitative results are presented in Table 4.1 where the likelihood and the error
are averaged over the last 200 MCMC samples. Figure 4 shows the solutions
found by the two models. The MCMC sample with the highest log probability
under the posterior was used. The BEP successfully ﬁnds the true features and
Z matrix, whereas the independent IBP model ﬁnds a solution where additional
features are used in all of the 7 locations (see second and third row of Figure
4). The clean solution provided by BEP shows that leveraging the dependence
among consecutive feature allocations greatly improves performance. Table 4.1
conﬁrms this quantitatively: the BEP model performs considerably better both
in terms of test error and likelihood. While the independent IBP looks good
in terms of training error/likelihood, the big diﬀerence in the performance in
terms of the test likelihood suggests this is overﬁtting.

Next, we explore the ability of BEP to recover latent features in a synthetic
time series network data. We hand-constructed a set of six square binary ma-
trices which encode the friendship links among N = 20 people evolving through
time, as shown in Figure 5. People form groups which determine the links and
non-links between them. As time passes, the partitioning of people changes:
new friendship links are created while others break. The closer in time two
snapshots are, the more similar we expect the related partitions to be. We ran
BEP using the network likelihood model in Equation (16) for 2000 MCMC iter-
ations keeping the last 400 samples for estimation and holding 10% of the data
out for prediction. For comparison, we used independent LFRM models at each
timepoint. The BEP model outperforms the independent LFRM in terms of
both test error and likelihood (Table 4.1) while, analogously to the linear Gaus-
sian setting, the independent LFRM seems to overﬁt yielding “better” values in

Figure 6 shows the features found in the sample with the highest log probability
under the posterior. Both show ﬁgures the slow evolution of the feature alloca-
tion dictated by the BEP; once objects are allocated to a feature, the feature
membership remains the same until the feature dies. For instance, moving from
time location 1 to 2 explains the data by keeping feature 17 alive (with the same
10 members) and introducing features 12 and 15. The LFRM is overly ﬂexible
since it assigns objects to features at each location independently. As such, it
explains the observations at the second time location using two features created
independently from the ones in the previous location.

independent IBP’s are shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10 respectively. The BEP
model allows for a smooth evolution of the latent feature allocation inferred as
opposed to the independe IBP’s where the latent structure is explained with
rapid changing allocations and with considerable diﬀerences in the number of

As such, covariate dependence over the alloca-

From the BEP reconstruction in Figure 5(b) we see the promoter region around
18kb-19kb with high H3K27ac, the transcribed region of the WASH7P gene from
8kb-18kb, and the repressive H3K29me3 and H3K9me3 marks further down-
stream, corresponding to polycomb repression and heterochromatin.

4.3 van de Bunt’s dataset

In van de Bunt et al. (1999), 32 university freshman students in a given discipline
at a Dutch university were surveyed at seven time points about who in their class
they considered as friends. Initially, i.e. t1, most of the students were unknown
to each other. The ﬁrst four time points are three weeks apart, whereas the last
three time points are six weeks apart as showin in Figure 11.
