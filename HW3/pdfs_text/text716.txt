Abstract

Many studies in biomedical and health sciences
involve small sample sizes due to logistic or ﬁ-
nancial constraints. Often, identifying weak (but
scientiﬁcally interesting) associations between
a set of predictors and a response necessitates
pooling datasets from multiple diverse labs or
groups. While there is a rich literature in statis-
tical machine learning to address distributional
shifts and inference in multi-site datasets, it is
less clear when such pooling is guaranteed to
help (and when it does not) – independent of the
inference algorithms we use. In this paper, we
present a hypothesis test to answer this question,
both for classical and high dimensional linear re-
gression. We precisely identify regimes where
pooling datasets across multiple sites is sensi-
ble, and how such policy decisions can be made
via simple checks executable on each site before
any data transfer ever happens. With a focus on
Alzheimer’s disease studies, we present empiri-
cal results showing that in regimes suggested by
our analysis, pooling a local dataset with data
from an international study improves power.

1. Introduction

In the last two decades, statistical machine learning algo-
rithms for processing massive datasets have been inten-
sively studied for a wide-range of applications in computer
vision, biology, chemistry and healthcare (Murdoch & Det-
sky, 2013; Tarca et al., 2007). While the challenges posed
by large scale datasets are compelling, one is often faced
with a fairly distinct set of technical issues for studies in bi-
ological and health sciences. For instance, a sizable portion

of scientiﬁc research is carried out by small or medium-
sized groups (Fortin & Currie, 2013) supported by modest
budgets (Lauer, 2016). Hence, there are logistic/ﬁnancial
constraints on the number of experiments and/or number
of participants within a trial, leading to small size datasets.
While the analysis may be sufﬁciently powered to evalu-
ate the primary hypothesis of the study/experiment, inter-
esting follow-up scientiﬁc questions (often more nuanced),
come up during the course of the project. These tasks may
be underpowered for the sample sizes available. This ne-
cessitates efforts to identify similar datasets elsewhere so
that the combined sample size of the “pooled” dataset is
enough to determine signiﬁcant associations between a re-
sponse and a set of predictors, e.g., within linear regression.

Motivating Application.
In genomics, funding agencies
have invested effort into standardizing/curating data collec-
tion across large international projects (ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2004).
In other disciplines, such as in the
study of neurological disorders, heterogeneity in disease
etiology, variations in scanners and/or acquisition tools
make standardization more difﬁcult. For Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (AD), a motivation of this work, efforts such as ADNI
(Weiner et al., 2015) provide a variety of clinical, imaging
and cognitive tests data for 800+ older adults. However,
the research focus has now moved to the early stages of
disease – as early as late middle age – where treatments are
expected to be more effective. But (a) the statistical sig-
nal at this stage is weak and difﬁcult to demonstrate with-
out large sample sizes and (b) such “preclinical” partici-
pants are not well represented, even in large ADNI sized
studies. Hence, there is a concerted effort in general for
smaller standalone projects (focused on a speciﬁc disease
stage), that can be retrospectively pooled for analysis to-
wards addressing a challenging scientiﬁc hypothesis (Ja-
hanshad et al., 2013). Unfortunately, acquisition protocols
for various measures across sites are usually different and
data are heterogeneous. These issues raise a fundamental
technical question. When is it meaningful to pool datasets
for estimating a simple statistical model (e.g., linear regres-
sion)? When can we guarantee improvements in statistical
power, and when are such pooling efforts not worth it? Can
we give a hypothesis test and obtain p-values to inform our
policies/decisions? While related problems have been stud-

When can Multi-Site Datasets be Pooled for Regression?

ied in machine learning from an algorithm design perspec-
tive, even simple hypothesis tests which can be deployed
by a researcher in practice, are currently unavailable. Our
goal is to remove this signiﬁcant limitation.

Putting our development in context. The realization that
“similar” datasets from multiple sites can be pooled to po-
tentially improve statistical power is not new. With varying
empirical success, models tailored to perform regression
in multi-site studies (Group, 2002), (Haase et al., 2009),
(Klunk et al., 2015) have been proposed, where due to op-
erational reasons, recruitment and data acquisition are dis-
tributed over multiple sites, or even countries. When the
pooling is being performed retrospectively (i.e., after the
data has been collected), resolving site-speciﬁc confounds,
such as distributional shifts or biases in measurements, is
essential before estimation/inference of a statistical model.
We will not develop new algorithms for estimating the dis-
tributional mismatch or for performing multi-site regres-
sion — rather, our primary goal is to identify the regimes
(and give easily computable checks) where this regression
task on a pooled dataset is statistically meaningful, assum-
ing that good pre-processing schemes are available. We
will present a rigorous yet simple to implement hypothesis
test, analyze its behavior, and show extensive experimental
evidence (for an important scientiﬁc problem). The prac-
titioner is free to use his/her preferred procedure for the
“before step” (estimating the distributional shifts).

Contributions: a) Our main result is a hypothesis test to
evaluate whether pooling data across multiple sites for re-
gression (before or after correcting for site-speciﬁc distri-
butional shifts) can improve the estimation (mean squared
error) of the relevant coefﬁcients (while permitting an in-
ﬂuence from a set of confounding variables). b) We de-
rive analogous results in the high-dimensional setting by
leveraging a different set of analysis techniques. Using
an existing sparse multi-task Lasso model, we show how
the utility of pooling can be evaluated even when the sup-
port set of the features (predictors) is not exactly the same
across sites using ideas broadly related to high dimensional
simultaneous inference (Dezeure et al., 2015). We show
(cid:96)2-consistency rate, which supports the use of sparse multi-
task Lasso when sparsity patterns are not totally identical.
c) On an important scientiﬁc problem of analyzing early
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) individuals, we provide com-
pelling experimental results showing consistent acceptance
rate and statistical power. Via a publicly available soft-
ware package, this will facilitate many multi-site regression
analysis efforts in the short to medium term future.

1.1. Related Work

Meta-analysis approaches. If datasets at multiple differ-
ent sites cannot be shared or pooled, the task of deriving

meaningful scientiﬁc conclusions from results of multiple
independently conducted analyses generally falls under the
umbrella term of “meta analysis”. The literature provides
various strategies to cumulate the general ﬁndings from
analyses on different datasets. But even experts believe
that, minor violations of assumptions can lead to mislead-
ing scientiﬁc conclusions (Greco et al., 2013), and substan-
tial personal judgment (and expertise) is needed to conduct
them. It is widely accepted that when the ability to pool the
data is an option, simpler schemes may perform better.

Domain adaptation/shift. Separately,
the idea of ad-
dressing “shift” within datasets has been rigorously stud-
ied within statistical machine learning, see (Patel et al.,
2015; Li, 2012). For example, domain adaptation, includ-
ing dataset and covariate shift, seeks to align (the distri-
butions of) multiple datasets to enable follow-up process-
ing (Ben-David & Schuller, 2003). Typically, such algo-
rithms assume a bias in the sampling process, and adopt re-
weighting as the solution (Huang et al., 2007; Gong et al.,
2013). Alternatively, a family of such methods assume
that sites (or datasets) differ due to feature distortions (e.g.,
calibration error), which are resolved, in general, by min-
imizing some distance measure between appropriate dis-
tributions (Baktashmotlagh et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2011;
Long et al., 2015; Ganin et al., 2016). In general, these ap-
proaches have nice theoretical properties (Ben-David et al.,
2010; Cortes & Mohri, 2011; Zhou et al., 2016). However,
it is important to note that the domain adaptation literature
focuses on the algorithm itself – to resolve the distribu-
tional site-wise differences. It does not address the issue
of whether pooling the datasets, after applying the calcu-
lated adaptation (i.e., transformation), is beneﬁcial. Our
goal in this work is to assess whether multiple datasets can
be pooled — either before or usually after applying the best
domain adaptation methods — for improving our estima-
tion of the relevant coefﬁcients within linear regression. We
propose a hypothesis test to directly address this question.

The high-dimensional case. High dimensional scenar-
ios, in general, involve predicting a response (e.g., cogni-
tive score) from high dimensional predictors such as image
scans (or derived features) and genetic data, which in gen-
eral, entails Lasso-type formulations unlike the classical re-
gression models. Putting multi-task representation learning
(Maurer et al., 2016; Ando & Zhang, 2005; Maurer et al.,
2013) together with a sparsity regularizer, we get the multi-
task Lasso model (Liu et al., 2009; Kim & Xing, 2010).
Although this seems like a suitable model (Chen et al.,
2012), it assumes that the multiple tasks (sites here) have an
identical active set of predictors. Instead, we ﬁnd that the
sparse multi-task Lasso (Lee et al., 2010), roughly, a multi-
task version of sparse group Lasso (Simon et al., 2013; Lee
et al., 2010) is a better starting point. There is no theoretical
analysis in (Simon et al., 2013); although a (cid:96)2-consistency

When can Multi-Site Datasets be Pooled for Regression?

for sparse group lasso is derived in (Chatterjee et al., 2012)
using a general proof procedure for M-estimators, it does
not take into account the speciﬁc sparse group Lasso prop-
erties. This makes the result non-informative for sparse
group Lasso (much less, sparse multi-task Lasso). Specif-
ically, as we will see shortly, in sparse multi-task Lasso,
the joint effects of two penalties induces a special type of
asymmetric structure. We show a new result, in the style
of Lasso (Meinshausen & Yu, 2009; Liu & Zhang, 2009b),
for (cid:96)2 convergence rate for this model. It matches known
results for Lasso/group Lasso, and identiﬁes regimes where
the sparse multi-task (multi-site) setting is advantageous.

Simultaneous High dimensional Inference.
Simulta-
neous high dimensional inference models such as multi
sample-splitting and de-biased Lasso is an active research
topic in statistics (Dezeure et al., 2015). Multi sample-
splitting use half of the dataset for variable selection and
the rest for calculating p-values. De-biased Lasso chooses
one feature as a response and the others as predictors to
estimate a Lasso model;
this procedure is repeated for
each feature. Estimators from De-biased Lasso asymptot-
ically follow the multi-normal distribution (Dezeure et al.,
2016), and using Bonferroni-Holm adjustment produces
simultaneous p-values. Such ideas together with the (cid:96)2-
convergence results for sparse multitask Lasso, will help
extend our analysis to the high dimensional setting.

2. Hypothesis Test for Multi-Site Regression

We ﬁrst describe a simple setting where one seeks to ap-
ply standard linear regression to data pooled from multiple
sites. For presentation purposes, we will deal with vari-
able selection issues later. Within this setup, we will in-
troduce our main result — a hypothesis test to evaluate
statistical power improvements (e.g., mean squared error)
when running a regression model on a pooled dataset. We
will see that the proposed test is transparent to the use of
adaptation algorithms, if any, to pre-process the multi-site
data (more details in appendix). In later sections, we will
present convergence analysis and extensions to the large
p setting. Matrices (vectors/scalars) are upper case (and
lower case). (cid:107).(cid:107)∗ is the nuclear norm.

We ﬁrst introduce the single-site regression model. Let
X ∈ Rn×p and y ∈ Rn×1 denote the feature matrix of
predictors and the response vector respectively. If β cor-
responds to the coefﬁcient vector (i.e., predictor weights),
then the regression model is

min

where y = Xβ∗ + (cid:15) and (cid:15) ∼ N (0, σ2) I.I.D. if β∗ is
the true coefﬁcient vector from which y is generated. The
mean-squared error (MSE) and (cid:96)2-consistency of regres-

sion is well-known. The mean-squared error (MSE) of (1)
is E(cid:107) ˆβ − β∗(cid:107)2
If k denotes the
number of sites, then one may ﬁrst apply a domain adap-
tation scheme to account for the distributional shifts be-
tween the k different predictors {Xi}k
i=1, and then run a
regression model. If the underlying “concept” (i.e., predic-
tors and responses relationship) can be assumed to be the
same across the different sites, then it is reasonable to im-
pose the same β for all sites. For instance, the inﬂuence of
CSF protein measurements on cognitive scores of an indi-
vidual may be invariant to demographics. Nonetheless, if
the distributional mismatch correction is imperfect, we may
deﬁne ∆βi = βi − β∗ where i ∈ {1, . . . , k} as the resid-
ual difference between the site-speciﬁc coefﬁcients and the
true shared coefﬁcient vector (in the ideal case, we have
∆βi = 0). In the multi-site setting, we can write

min

where for each site i we have yi = Xiβ∗ + Xi∆βi + (cid:15)i and
(cid:15)i ∼ N (0, σ2
I.I.D. Here, τi is a weighting parameter
i )
for each site, if such information is available.

Our main goal is to test if the combined regression im-
proves the estimation for a single site. We can pose this
question in terms of improvements in the mean squared er-
ror (MSE). Hence, W.L.O.G. using site 1 as the reference,
we set τ1 = 1 in (2) and consider β∗ = β1,

Clearly, when the sample size is
not large enough,
the multi-site
formulation in (3) may reduce
variance signiﬁcantly, because of
the averaging effect in the objec-
tive function, while increasing the
bias by a little. This reduces the
Mean Squared Error (MSE), see
Figure 1. Note that while tra-
ditionally, the unbiasedness prop-
erty was desirable, an extensive
body of literature on ridge regres-
sion suggests that the quantity of
interest should really be E (cid:107) ˆβ −
β∗(cid:107)2
2 (Hoerl & Kennard, 1970; James & Stein, 1961).
These ideas are nicely studied within papers devoted to the
“bias-variance” trade-off. Similar to these results, we will
focus on the mean squared error because the asymptotic
consistency properties that come with an unbiased estima-
tor are not meaningful here anyway — the key reason we
want to pool datasets in the ﬁrst place is because of small
sample sizes. We now provide a result showing how the
tuning parameters τ2, . . . , τk can be chosen.

are 1st and 2nd site
coefﬁcients.
After
combination, β1’s bias
increases but variance
reduces, resulting in a
smaller MSE.

Theorem 2.1 τi = σ1
σi

achieves the smallest variance in ˆβ.

Remarks: This result follows from observing that the each
site’s contribution is inversely proportional to site-speciﬁc
noise level, σi. We will show that this choice of τis also
leads to a simple mechanism to setup a hypothesis test.

2.1. Sharing all βs

In the speciﬁcation above, the estimates of βi across all k
sites are restricted to be the same. Without this constraint,
(3) is equivalent to ﬁtting a regression separately on each
site. So, a natural question is whether this constraint im-
proves estimation. To evaluate whether MSE is reduced,
we ﬁrst need to quantify the change in the bias and vari-
ance of (3) compared to (1). To do so, we introduce a few
notations. Let ni be the sample size of site i, and let ˆβi
denote the regression estimate from a speciﬁc site i. We
have ∆ ˆβi = ˆβi − ˆβ1. We deﬁne the length kp vector ∆βT
k ) (similarly for ∆ ˆβT ). We use
as ∆βT = (∆βT
ˆΣi for the sample covariance matrix of the data (predictors)
from the site i and G ∈ R(k−1)p×(k−1)p for the covariance
matrix of ∆ ˆβ, where Gii = (n1 ˆΣ1)−1 + (niτ 2
ˆΣi)−1 and
i
Gij = (n1 ˆΣ1)−1 whenever i (cid:54)= j.

Remarks: The above result bounds the increase in bias and
the reduction in variance (see discussion of Figure 1). Since
our goal is to test MSE reduction — in principle, we can use
bootstrapping to calculate MSE approximately. This proce-
dure has a signiﬁcant computational footprint. Instead, (4)
(from a one-step Cauchy-Schwartz inequality), gives a suf-
ﬁcient condition for MSE reduction as shown below.

model (1) whenever

where (cid:107)G−1/2∆β/σ1(cid:107)2 is called a “condition value”.

Remarks: This is our main test result. Although σi is typ-
ically unknown, it can be easily replaced using its site-
speciﬁc estimation. Theorem 2.3 implies that we can con-
duct a non-central χ2 distribution test based on the statis-
tic. Also, (6) shows that the non-central χ2 distribution,
which the test statistics will follow, has a non-central pa-
rameter smaller than 1 when the sufﬁcient condition H0
holds. Meanwhile, in obtaining the (surprisingly simple)
sufﬁcient condition H0, no other arbitrary assumption is
needed except the application of Cauchy-Schwartz inequal-
ity. From a practical perspective, Theorem 2.3 implies that
the sites, in fact, do not even need to share the full dataset
to assess whether pooling will be useful. Instead, the test
only requires very high-level information such as ˆβi, ˆΣi,
σi and ni for all participating sites – which can be trans-
ferred very cheaply with no additional cost of data storage,
or privacy implications. The following result deals with the
special case where we have two participating sites.

Corollary 2.4 For the case where we have two participat-
ing sites, the condition (6) from Theorem 2.3 reduces to

H0 : ∆βT ((n1 ˆΣ1)−1 + (n2τ 2

ˆΣ2)−1)−1∆β ≤ σ2
1.

(8)

Remarks: The left side above relates to the Mahalanobis
distance between β1, β2 with covariance (n1 ˆΣ1)−1 +
ˆΣ2)−1, implying that the test statistic is a type of a
(n2τ 2
2
normalized metric between the two regression models.

2.2. Sharing a subset of βs

In numerous pooling scenarios, we are faced with certain
systemic differences in the way predictors and responses
associate across sites. For example, socio-economic sta-
tus may (or may not) have a signiﬁcant association with a
health outcome (response) depending on the country of the
study (e.g., due to insurance coverage policies). Unlike in
Section 2.1, we now relax the restriction that all coefﬁcients
are the same across sites, see Fig. 2. The model in (3) will
now include another design matrix of predictors Z ∈ Rn×q
and corresponding coefﬁcients γi for each site i,

i + (cid:15)i, τ1 = 1

(10)

Our goal is still to evaluate whether the MSE of β reduces.
We do not take into account the MSE change in γ because
they correspond to site-speciﬁc variables. For estimation,
ˆβ can ﬁrst be computed from (9). Treating it as a ﬁxed en-
tity now, ˆγi can be computed using yi and Zi on each site
independently. Clearly, if ˆβ is close to the “true” β∗, it will
also enable a better estimation of site-speciﬁc variables. It
turns out that, if ˆΣis are replaced by the conditional covari-
ance, the analysis from Section 2.1 still holds for this case.

When can Multi-Site Datasets be Pooled for Regression?

Speciﬁcally, let ˆΣabi be the sample covariance matrix be-
tween features a and b from some site i. We have,

Theorem 2.5 Analysis in Section 2.1 holds for β in (9) by
replacing ˆΣi with ˜Σi = ˆΣxxi − ˆΣxzi( ˆΣzzi)−1 ˆΣzxi

Remarks: The test now allows evaluating power improve-
ments focused only on the subset of coefﬁcients that is
shared and permits site-speciﬁc confounds. For example,
we can test which subset of parameters might beneﬁt from
parameter estimation on pooled data from multiple sites.

3. Pooling in High Dimensional Regression

We now describe our analysis of pooling multi-site data in
the high-dimensional setting where p (cid:29) n. The challenge
here is that variable section has to be a ﬁrst order concern.
In classical regression, (cid:96)2 consistency properties are well
known and so our focus in Section 2 was devoted to de-
riving sufﬁcient conditions for the hypothesis test. In other
words, imposing the same β across sites works in (3) be-
cause we understand its consistency. In contrast, here, one
cannot enforce a shared β for all sites before the active set
of predictors within each site are selected — directly im-
posing the same β leads to a loss of (cid:96)2-consistency, making
follow-up analysis problematic. Therefore, once a suitable
model for high-dimensional multi-site regression is chosen,
the ﬁrst requirement is to characterize its consistency.

We start with the multi-task Lasso (a special case of group
Lasso) (Liu et al., 2009), where the authors show that the
strategy selects better explanatory features compared to
separately ﬁtting Lasso on each site. But this algorithm un-
derperforms when the sparsity pattern of the predictors is
not identical across sites, so we use a recent variant called
sparse multi-task Lasso (Lee et al., 2010) – essentially sub-
stituting “sites” for “tasks”. The sparse multi-site Lasso in
p (cid:29) n setting (p is the number of predictors) is given as

where λ is the Lasso regularization parameter. Here, B ∈

Rk×p is a matrix where the ith row gives the coefﬁcients
from ith site (k sites in total). Also, βi with subscript de-
notes the ith row (site) of B, we use βj with superscript
to give the j-th column (coefﬁcients) of B. The hyper-
parameter α ∈ [0, 1] balances the two penalties (and will
be used shortly); a larger α weighs the (cid:96)1 penalty more and
a smaller α puts more weight on the grouping. Similar to a
Lasso-based regularization parameter, λ here will produce
a solution path (to select coefﬁcients) for a given α. We
ﬁrst address the consistency behavior of the sparse multi-
site Lasso in (11), which was not known in the literature.

3.1. (cid:96)2 consistency

Our analysis of (11) is related to known results for Lasso
(Meinshausen & Yu, 2009) and the group Lasso (Liu &
Zhang, 2009a). Recall that X1, . . . , Xk are the data ma-
trices from k sites. We deﬁne ¯n = maxk
i=1{ni} and
C = ¯n−1DIAG(X T
k Xk) where DIAG(A, B)
corresponds to constructing a block-diagonal matrix with
A and B as blocks on the diagonal. We require the follow-
ing useful properties of C ((cid:107)·(cid:107)0 denotes (cid:96)0-norm).

values of C, denoted by φmin(m) and φmax(m), are

We call a feature “active” if its coefﬁcient is non-zero.

Now, each site may have different active features:
sh ≤ kp be the sum of the number of active features over
all sites. Similarly, sp is the cardinality of the union of fea-
tures that are active in at least one site (sh ≤ ksp, sp ≤ p).
Recall that when α (cid:54)= 0, we add the Lasso penalty to the
multi-site Lasso penalty. When the sparsity patterns are as-
sumed to be similar across all sites, α is small. In contrast,
to encourage site-speciﬁc sparsity patterns, we may set α
to be large. We now analyze these cases independently.

Remarks: The above result agrees with known results for
multi-task Lasso (Liu et al., 2009; Liu & Zhang, 2009b)
when the sparsity patterns are the same across sites. The
simplest way to interpret Theorem 3.2 is via the ratio r =
sh
. Here, r = k when the sparsity patterns are the same
sp
across sites. As r decreases, the sparsity patterns across
sites start to differ, in turn, the sparse multi-site Lasso
from (11) will provide stronger consistency compared to
the multi-site Lasso (which corresponds to α = 0). In other
words, whenever we expect site-speciﬁc active features, the
(cid:96)2 consistency of (11) will improve as one includes an ad-
ditional (cid:96)1-penalty together with multi-site Lasso.

large), the sparse multi-site Lasso has stronger consistency
compared to Lasso (α = 1). The sparse multi-site Lasso is
preferable as r = sh
increases. Note that although ˜α and
sp
˜λ are used for the results instead of α and λ, in practice,
one can simply scale the chosen αs appropriately, e.g., with
k = 100, we see that α ≈ 0.99 corresponds to ˜α = 0.95.

Performing hypothesis tests: Theorems 3.2 and 3.3
show consistency of sparse multi-site Lasso estimation.
Hence, if the hyper-parameters α and λ are known, we
can estimate the coefﬁcients B∗. This variable selection
phase can be followed by a hypothesis test, similar to The-
orem 2.3 from Section 2. The only remaining issue is the
choice of α. The existing methods show that joint cross-
validation for α and λ performs unsatisfactorily and instead
use a heuristic: set it to 0.05 when it is known that sparsity

patterns are similar across sites and 0.95 otherwise (Simon
et al., 2013). Below, instead of a ﬁxed α, we provide a
data-driven alternative that works well in practice.

Choosing α using simultaneous inference: Our results
in Thm. 3.2 (and Thm. 3.3 resp.) seem to suggest that
increasing (and decreasing resp.) α will always improve
consistency; however, this ends up requiring stronger m-
sparsity conditions. We now describe a procedure to choose
α. First, recall that an active feature corresponds to a vari-
able with non-zero coefﬁcient. We call a feature “site-
active” if it is active at a site, an “always-active” feature
is active at all k sites. The proposed solution involves three
steps. (1) First, we apply simultaneous inference (like multi
sample-splitting or de-biased Lasso) using all features at
each of the k sites with FWER control. This step yields
“site-active” features for each site, and therefore, gives the
set of always-active features and the sparsity patterns. (2)
Then, each site runs a Lasso and chooses a λi based on
cross-validation. We then set λmulti−site to be the mini-
mum among the best λ’s from each site. Using λmulti−site,
we can vary α to ﬁt various sparse multi-site Lasso mod-
els – each run will select some number of always-active
features. We plot α versus the number of always-active
features. (3) Finally, based on the sparsity patterns from
the site-active set, we estimate whether the sparsity pat-
terns across sites are similar or different (i.e., share few ac-
tive features). Then, based on the plot from step (2), if the
sparsity patterns from the site-active sets are different (sim-
ilar) across sites, then the smallest (largest) value of α that
selects the minimum (maximum) number of always-active
features is chosen. The appendix includes details.

4. Experiments

Our experiments are two-fold. First we perform simu-
lations evaluating the hypothesis test from §2 and sparse
multi-site Lasso from §3. We then evaluate pooling two
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) datasets from different studies
to evaluate improvements in power, and checking whether
the proposed tests provide insights into the regimes when
pooling is beneﬁcial for regression, and will yield tangible
statistical beneﬁts in investigating scientiﬁc hypotheses.

Power and Type I Error of Theorem 2.3: The ﬁrst set
of simulations evaluate the setting from Section 2.1 where
the coefﬁcients are same across two different sites. The
inputs for the two sites are set as X1, X2(∈ Rn×3) ∼
N (0, Σ) with Σ = 0.5(I + E) (where I is identity and E
is a 3 × 3 matrix of 1s). The true coefﬁcients are given by
β1 ∼ U (0, 4I) and β2 = β1 + 0.1 (where U (·) is multivari-
ate uniform), and the noise corresponds to (cid:15)1 ∼ N (0, 3I)
and (cid:15)2 ∼ N (0, 0.5I) for the two sites respectively. With
this design, the responses are set as y1 = X1β1 + (cid:15)1 and
y2 = X2β2 + (cid:15)2. Using {X1, y1} and {X2, y2}, the shared

ˆβ are estimated. The simulation is repeated 100 times with
9 different sample sizes (n = 2b with b = 4, . . . , 12) for
each repetition. Fig. 3(a) shows the MSE of two-site (blue
bars) and a baseline single-site (red bars) model computed
using the corresponding ˆβs on site 1. Although both MSEs
decrease as n increases, the two-sites model consistently
produces smaller MSE – with large gains for small sample
sizes (left-end of Fig. 3(a)). Fig. 3(d) shows the accep-
tance rates of our proposed hypothesis test (from (6) and
(8)) with 0.05 signiﬁcance level. The purple solid line is
the sufﬁcient condition from Theorem 2.3, while the dot-
ted line is where the MSE of the baseline single-site model
starts to decrease below that of the two-site model. The
trend in Fig. 3(d) implies that as n increases, the test tends
to reject pooling the multi-site data with power → 1. Fur-
ther, the type I error is well-controlled to the left of the
solid line, and is low between the two lines. See appendix
for additional details about Figs. 3(a,d).

Power and Type I Error of Theorem 2.5: The sec-

γ2 = (2, 2, 2, 1, 1)T are the coefﬁcients for Z1 and Z2 re-
spectively. The new responses y1 and y2 will have the extra
terms Z1γ1 and Z2γ2 respectively. Fig. 3(b,e) shows the
results. All the observations from Fig. 3(a,d) hold here as
well. For small n, MSE of two-site model is much smaller
than baseline, and as sample size increases this difference
reduces. The test accepts with high probability for small n,
and as sample size increases it rejects with high power. The
regimes of low type I error and high power in Fig. 3(e) are
similar to those from Fig. 3(d).

4.1. Sparse multi-sites Lasso (cid:96)2-consistency

We now use 4 sites with n = 150 samples each and p =
400 features to test the sparse multi-site model from §3.
We set the design matrices Xi (i = 1, . . . , 4) ∼ N (0, Σ)
with Σ = 0.8Ip×p + 0.2Ep×p. We consider the two cases
(sparsity patterns shared/not shared) separately.

6 shared features and 14
Few sparsity patterns shared:
site-speciﬁc features (out of the 400) are set to be active in
4 sites. Each shared feature is sampled from U (0, 4) for
the ﬁrst two sites and U (0, 0.5) for the rest. All the site-
speciﬁc features are ∼ U (0, 4). The noise (cid:15)i ∼ N (0, 1),
and the responses are yi = Xiβi + (cid:15)i. Fig. 3(c) shows
the 10-fold cross validation error as λ changes (i.e., so-
lution path) for different α settings, including the value
from our proposed selection procedure (from Section 3.1),
Lasso (α = 1), group Lasso (α = 0) and arbitrary val-
ues α = 0.05, 0.95 (as suggested by (Simon et al., 2013)).

Our chosen α = 0.97 (the blue curve in Fig. 3(c)) has
the smallest error, across all λs, thereby implying a bet-
ter (cid:96)2 consistency. Table 1 in the appendix includes more
details, including α = 0.97 discovers more always-active
features, while preserving the ratio of correctly discovered
active features to all the discovered ones.

Most sparsity patterns shared: Unlike the earlier case,
here we set 16 shared and 4 site-speciﬁc features (both
∼ U (0, 4)) to be active among all 400 features. The result,
shown in Fig. 3(f), is similar to Fig. 3(c). The proposed
choice of α = 0.25 competes favorably with alternate
choices while preserving the correctly discovered number
of always-active features. Unlike the previous case, the ra-
tio of correctly discovered active features to all discovered
ones increases here (see appendix).

4.2. Combining AD datasets from multiple sites

We now evaluate whether two AD datasets acquired at dif-
ferent sites – an Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimage Initiative
(ADNI) dataset and a local dataset from Wisconsin ADRC
(ADlocal) can be combined (appendix has dataset details).
The sample sizes are 318 and 156 respectively. Cere-
brospinal ﬂuid (CSF) protein levels are the inputs, and the
response is hippocampus volume. Using 81 age-matched
samples from each dataset, we ﬁrst perform domain adap-
tation (using a maximum mean discrepancy objective as
a measure of distance between the two marginals), and
then transform CSF proteins from ADlocal to match with
ADNI. The transformed data is then used to evaluate
whether adding ADlocal data to ADNI will improve the
regression performed on the ADNI data. This is done by
training a regression model on the ‘transformed’ ADlocal
and a subset of ADNI data, and then testing the resulting
model on the remaining ADNI samples. We use two base-
line models each of which are trained using – ADNI data
alone; and non-transformed ADlocal (with ADNI subset).

Fig. 4(a,b) show the resulting mean prediction error (MPE)
scaled by the estimated noise level in ADNI responses, and
the corresponding acceptance rate (with signiﬁcance level
0.05) respectively. The x-axis in Fig. 4(a,b) represents
the size of ADNI subset used for training. As expected,
the MPE reduces as this subset size increases. Most im-
portantly, pooling after transformation (green bars) seems
to be the most beneﬁcial in terms of MPE reduction. As
shown in Fig. 4(a), to the left of purple line where the
subset size is smaller than ADlocal datasize, pooling the
datasets improves estimation. This is the small sample size
regime which necessitates pooling efforts in general. As
the dataset size increases (to the right of x-axis in Fig. 4(a))
the resulting MPE for the pooled model is close to what we
will achieve using the ADNI data by itself.

Since pooling after transformation is at least as good as us-

acceptance rates for (a,c). Unlike in (a), (c) restricts same training data size for ADNI and ADlocal.

ing ADNI data alone, our hypothesis test accepts the com-
bination with high rate (≈ 95%), see Fig. 4(b). The test
rejects the pooling strategy with high power for combin-
ing before domain adaptation (see Fig. 4(b)), as one would
expect. This rejection power increases rapidly as sample
size increases, see red curve in Fig. 4(b). The results in
Fig. 4(c,d) show the setting where one cannot change the
dataset sizes at the sites i.e., the training set uses an equal
number of labeled samples from both the ADNI and AD-
local (x-axis in Fig. 4(c)), and the testing set always cor-
responds to 20% of ADNI data. This is a more interesting
scenario for a practitioner compared to Fig. 4(a,b), because
in Fig. 4(c,d) we use same sample sizes for both datasets.
The trends in Fig. 4(c,d) are the same as Fig. 4(a,b).

5. Conclusions

We present a hypothesis test to answer whether pooling
multiple datasets acquired from different sites is guaran-

teed to increase statistical power for regression models.
For both standard and high dimensional linear regression,
we identify regimes where such pooling is sensible, and
show how such policy decisions can be made via simple
checks executable on each site before any data transfer ever
happens. We also show empirical results by combining
two Alzheimer’s disease datasets in the context of different
regimes proposed by our analysis, and see that the regres-
sion ﬁt improves as suggested by the theory. The code is
available at https://github.com/hzhoustat/ICML2017.
