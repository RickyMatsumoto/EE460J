Abstract

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)
exploits
Hamiltonian dynamics to construct efﬁcient pro-
posals for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
In this paper, we present a generalization of
HMC which exploits non-canonical Hamiltonian
dynamics. We refer to this algorithm as magnetic
HMC, since in 3 dimensions a subset of the dy-
namics map onto the mechanics of a charged par-
ticle coupled to a magnetic ﬁeld. We establish
a theoretical basis for the use of non-canonical
Hamiltonian dynamics in MCMC, and construct
a symplectic, leapfrog-like integrator allowing
for the implementation of magnetic HMC. Fi-
nally, we exhibit several examples where these
non-canonical dynamics can lead to improved
mixing of magnetic HMC relative to ordinary
HMC.

1. Introduction

Probabilistic inference in complex models generally re-
quires the evaluation of intractable, high-dimensional inte-
grals. One powerful and generic approach to inference is to
use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to gen-
erate asymptotically exact (but correlated) samples from a
posterior distribution for inference and learning. Hamilto-
nian Monte Carlo (HMC) (Duane et al., 1987; Neal, 2011)
is a state-of-the-art MCMC method which uses gradient in-
formation from an absolutely continuous target density to
encourage efﬁcient sampling and exploration. Crucially,
HMC utilizes proposals inspired by Hamiltonian dynamics
(corresponding to the classical mechanics of a point parti-
cle) which can traverse long distances in parameter space.
HMC, and variants like NUTS (which eliminates the need
to hand-tune the algorithm’s hyperparameters), have been
successfully applied to a large class of probabilistic infer-
ence problems where they are often the gold standard for

MHMC (right) for an isotropic Gaussian target distribution.

In this paper, we ﬁrst review important properties of Hamil-
tonian dynamics, namely energy-preservation, symplectic-
ity, and time-reversibility, and derive a more general class
of dynamics with these properties which we refer to as non-
canonical Hamiltonian dynamics. We then discuss the re-
lationship of non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics to well-
known variants of HMC and propose a novel extension of
HMC. We refer to this method as magnetic HMC (see Al-
gorithm 1) since it corresponds to a particular subset of the
non-canonical dynamics that in 3 dimensions map onto to
the mechanics of a charged particle coupled to a magnetic
ﬁeld – see Figure 1 for an example of these dynamics. Fur-
thermore, we construct an explicit, symplectic, leapfrog-
like integrator for magnetic HMC which allows for an efﬁ-
cient numerical integration scheme comparable to that of
ordinary HMC. Finally, we evaluate the performance of
magnetic HMC on several sampling problems where we
show how its non-canonical dynamics can lead to improved
mixing. The proofs of all results in this paper are presented
in the corresponding sections of the Appendix.

2. Markov chain Monte Carlo

Given an unnormalized target density ρ(θ) deﬁned on Rd,
an MCMC algorithm constructs an ergodic Markov chain
(Θn)n∈N such that the distribution of Θn converges to ρ
(e.g. in total variation) (Robert & Casella, 2004). Often, the
transition kernel of such a Markov chain is speciﬁed by the
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm which (i) given the

Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

(cid:16)

current state Θn = θ, proposes a new state (cid:101)θ by sampling
θ), and (ii) sets Θn+1 = (cid:101)θ
from a proposal distribution Q(
·|
1, ρ((cid:101)θ)Q(θ|(cid:101)θ)
with probability min
and Θn+1 = θ oth-
ρ(θ)Q((cid:101)θ|θ)
erwise. The role of the acceptance step is to enforce re-
versibility (or detailed balance) of the Markov chain with
respect to ρ – which implies ρ is a stationary distribution of
the transition kernel.

(cid:17)

Heuristically, a good MH algorithm should have low inter-
sample correlation while maintaining a high acceptance ra-
tio. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo provides an elegant mecha-
nism to do this by simulating a particle moving along the
contour lines of a dynamical system, constructed from the
target density, to use as a MCMC proposal.

2.1. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

In Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the target distribution is aug-
mented with “momentum” variables p which are indepen-
dent of the θ variables but of equal dimension. For the
remainder of the paper, we take the distribution over the
momentum variables to be Gaussian, as is common in the
literature (indeed, there is evidence that in many cases, the
choice of a Gaussian distribution may be optimal (Betan-
court, 2017)). The joint target distribution is therefore:

ρ(θ, p)

e−U (θ)−p(cid:62)p/2

e−H(θ,p).

(1)

∝

≡

Crucially, this augmentation allows Hamiltonian dynamics
to be used as a proposal for an MCMC algorithm over the
space (θ, p), where we interpret θ (resp., p) as position
(resp., momentum) coordinates of a physical particle with
total energy H(θ, p), given by the sum of its potential en-
ergy U (θ) and kinetic energy p(cid:62)p/2. We brieﬂy review
the Markov chain construction below; see (Neal, 2011) or
(Duane et al., 1987) for a more detailed description. Given
the Markov chain state (θn, pn) at time n, the new state
for time n + 1 is obtained by ﬁrst resampling momentum
pn
(0, I), and then proposing a new state according to
the following steps: (i) Simulate the deterministic Hamil-
tonian ﬂow deﬁned by the differential equation

1Throughout this paper, we use Φτ,H to denote the map that
takes a given position-momentum pair as initial conditions for the

Apply a MH-type accept/reject step to enforce detailed bal-
ance with respect to the target distribution; (iv) Flip the mo-
mentum again with Φp so it points in the original direction.

Note that because the map Φτ,H is time-reversible (in
the sense that if the path (θ(t), p(t)) is a solution to (2)
then the path with negated momentum traversed in reverse
(θ(
t)) is also a solution), the map (cid:101)Φτ,H is self-
inverse. From this, the acceptance ratio in step (iii) enforc-
ing detailed balance can be shown (see e.g. (Green, 1995))
to have the form:

(3)

Note that the Hamiltonian ﬂow & momentum ﬂip op-
erator (cid:101)Φτ,H is volume-preserving2, which immediately
yields that the Jacobian term in the acceptance ratio (3)
is simply 1. The acceptance probability therefore reduces
to min(1, exp(H(θn, pn)
H((cid:101)θn+1, (cid:101)pn+1))). Further-
more, since the Hamiltonian ﬂow deﬁned in (2) is energy-
preserving (i.e. H((cid:101)θn+1, (cid:101)pn+1) = H(θn, pn)) – the ac-
ceptance ratio is identically 1. Moreover, the momentum
resampling in (i) and momentum ﬂip in (iv) both leave the
joint distribution invariant.

−

While the momentum resampling ensures the Markov
chain explores the joint (θ, p) space, the proposals inspired
by Hamiltonian dynamics can traverse long distances in
parameter space θ, reducing the random-walk behavior of
MH that often results in highly correlated samples (Neal,
2011).

2.2. Symplectic Numerical Integration

Unfortunately, it is rarely possible to integrate the ﬂow
deﬁned in (2) analytically; instead an efﬁcient numerical
integration scheme must be used to generate a proposal
for the MH-type accept/reject test. Typically, the leapfrog
(St¨ormer-Verlet) integrator is used since it is an explicit
method that is both symplectic and time-reversible (Neal,
2011). One elegant way to motivate this integrator is by
decomposing the Hamiltonian into a symmetric splitting:

H(θ, p) = U (θ)/2
(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)
H1(θ)

+ p(cid:62)p/2
(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)
H2(p)

+ U (θ)/2
(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)
H1(θ)

(4)

and then deﬁning Φ(cid:15),H1(θ) and Φ(cid:15),H2(p) to be the exactly-
integrated ﬂows for the sub-Hamiltonians H1(θ) and

(2)

Hamiltonian ﬂow associated with H for time τ . In addition, (cid:101)Φτ,H
denotes the composition of Φτ,H with the momentum ﬂip map
Φp.

2In fact

the Hamiltonian ﬂow satisﬁes

mediately implies it is volume-preserving by taking determinants
of this relation.

to Euler translations) can be written:

since the Hamilton equations (2) for the sub-Hamiltonians

As each of the ﬂows Φ(cid:15),H1(θ), Φ(cid:15),H2(p) exactly integrates
a sub-Hamiltonian, they inherit the symplecticity, volume-
preservation, and time-reversibility of the exact dynamics.
Moreover, since the composition of symplectic ﬂows is also
symplectic and the splitting scheme is symmetric (imply-
ing the composition of time-reversible ﬂows is also time-
reversible), the Jacobian term in the acceptance probability
(3) is exactly 1 as in the case of perfect simulation.

The leapfrog scheme will not exactly preserve the
Hamiltonian H,
so the remaining acceptance ratio
H((cid:101)θn+1, (cid:101)pn+1)) must be calculated.

However, the leapfrog integrator has error
leapfrog step (Hairer et al., 2006). This error scaling will
lead to good energy conservation properties (and thus high
acceptance rates in the MH step), even when simulating
over long trajectories.

3. Non-Canonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

In Section 2, we noted the role time-reversibility, volume-
preservation, and energy conservation of canonical Hamil-
tonian dynamics play in making them useful candidates for
MCMC. In this section, we develop the properties of a gen-
eral class of ﬂows we refer to as non-canonical Hamilto-
nian systems that parallel these properties, we use to con-
struct our method magnetic HMC (see Algorithm 1):

Within the formal construction of classical mechanics, it
is known that any Hamiltonian ﬂow deﬁned on the cotan-
gent bundle (θ, p) of a conﬁguration manifold, which is
equipped with an arbitrary symplectic 2-form, will pre-
serve its symplectic structure and admit the correspond-
ing Hamiltonian as a ﬁrst integral invariant (Arnold, 1989).
The statement of Lemma 1 is simply a restatement of
this fact grounded in a coordinate system. Similar arbi-
trary, antisymmetric terms have also appeared in the study
of MCMC algorithms based on diffusion processes; such
samplers often do not enforce detailed balance with re-
spect to the target density and are often implemented as dis-
cretizations of stochastic differential equations (Rey-Bellet
& Spiliopoulos, 2015; Ma et al., 2015), in contrast to the
approach taken here.

Our second observation is that the dynamics in (7) are not
time-reversible in the traditional sense. Instead, if we con-
sider the parametrization of A as:

A =

(cid:20) E

(8)

where E, G are antisymmetric and F is taken to be general
such that A is invertible, then the non-canonical dynamics
have a (pseudo) time-reversibility symmetry:

and:

Our solution to obtaining a time-reversible proposal is sim-
ply to ﬂip the elements of the E and G matrices just as
ordinary HMC ﬂips the auxiliary variable p i) at the end of
Hamiltonian ﬂow in the proposal and ii) once again after
the MH acceptance step to return p to its original direction.
In this vein, we view the parameters E and G as auxiliary
variables in the state space, and simultaneously ﬂip p, E,
and G after having simulated the dynamics, rendering the
proposal time-reversible according to Lemma 2 – see Sec-
tion 2 in the Appendix for full details of this construction.
This ensures that detailed balance is satisﬁed for this entire
proposal. To avoid “random walk” behaviour in the result-
ing Markov chain, we can apply a sign ﬂip to E and G,
in addition to p, to return them to their original directions
after the MH acceptance step.

The validity of this construction relies on equipping E and
G with symmetric auxiliary distributions. For the remain-
der of this paper, we further restrict to binary symmetric
auxiliary distributions supported on a given antisymmetric
matrix V0 and its sign ﬂip
V0 – see Appendix 1.1 for

full details. This restriction is not necessary, but gives rise
to a simple and interpretable class of algorithms, which is
in spirit closest to using ﬁxed parameters E and G, whilst
ensuring the proposal satisﬁes detailed balance. This con-
struction is also reminiscent of lifting constructions preva-
lent in the discrete Markov chain literature (Chen et al.,
1999); heuristically, the signed variables E and G favour
proposals in opposing directions.

to use an explicit, symplectic integration scheme;
in-
deed implicit integrators are used in Riemannian HMC to
maintain symplecticity of the proposal which comes at a
greater complexity and computational cost (Girolami et al.,
2009). However explicit, symplectic integrators are simple,
have good energy-conservation properties, and are volume-
preserving/time-reversible (Hairer et al., 2006), so for the
present discussion we restrict our attention to investigating
leapfrog-like schemes.

We begin, as in Section 2.2, by considering the symmet-
ric splitting (4), yielding the sub-Hamiltonians H1(θ) =
U (θ)/2, H2(p) = p(cid:62)p/2. The corresponding non-
canonical dynamics for the sub-Hamiltonians H1(θ) and
H2(p) are:

We denote the corresponding ﬂows by ΦA

explicitly tractable unless we take E = 0 – in which case
it is solved by an Euler translation as before. Crucially, the
ﬂow in ΦA

analytically integrable. If G is invertible (and F = I) then:

dles the general case where G is not invertible. Thus when

E = 0, the ﬂows ΦA
(cid:15),H2(p) are analytically
tractable and will inherit the generalized symplecticity and
(pseudo) time-reversibility of the exact dynamics in (7).
Therefore if we use the symmetric splitting (4) to construct
a leapfrog-like step:

(cid:15),H(θ,p) to generate leapfrog proposals, which interest-
ingly corresponds to a magnetic dynamics as discussed in
Lemma 4. A full description of the magnetic HMC algo-
rithm using this numerical integrator is described in Section
5.

4. Special Cases

Here, we describe several tractable subcases of the general
formulation of non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics since
these they have interesting physical interpretations.

4.1. Mass Preconditioned Dynamics

One simple variant of HMC is preconditioned HMC where
p
(0, M) (Neal, 2011), and can be implemented
nearly identically to ordinary HMC. We note that precon-
ditioning can be recovered within our framework using a
simple form for the non-canonical A matrix:

able p

(θ, p) coordinates using p = M1/2p(cid:48). Here M1/2 is a
Cholesky factor for M.

Using the results discussed in Section 3 and Section 3.1 we
can now propose Magnetic HMC – see Algorithm 1.

ii) On the other hand if we apply a change of basis (via an
invertible matrix F) to our coordinates θ(cid:48) = F−1θ, sim-
ulate HMC in the (θ(cid:48), p) coordinates, and transform back
to the original basis using F, this is exactly equivalent to

4.2. Magnetic Dynamics

The primary focus of this paper is to investigate the subcase
of the dynamics where:

A =

−
for two important reasons3. Firstly for this choice of A we
can construct an explicit, symplectic, leapfrog-like integra-
tion scheme which is important for developing an efﬁcient
HMC sampler as discussed in Section 3.1. Secondly, the
dynamics have an interesting physical interpretation quite
distinct from mass preconditioning and other HMC variants
like Riemannian HMC (Girolami et al., 2009):

Lemma 4. In 3 dimensions the non-canonical Hamiltonian
dynamics corresponding to the Hamiltonian H(θ, p) =
U (θ) + 1
2 p(cid:62)p and A matrix as in (14) are equivalent to
the Newtonian mechanics of a charged particle (with unit
mass and charge) coupled to a magnetic ﬁeld (cid:126)B (given
by a particular function of G - see Appendix): d2θ

−∇
This interpretation is perhaps surprising since Hamiltonian
formulations of classical magnetism are uncommon, al-
though the quantum mechanical treatment naturally incor-
porates a Hamiltonian framework. However, in light of
Lemma 3 we might wonder if by a clever rewriting of the
Hamiltonian we can reproduce this system of ODEs using
the canonical A matrix (i.e. E = G = 0, F = I). This is
not the case:

Lemma 5. The non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics with
magnetic A and Hamiltonian H(θ, p) = U (θ) + 1
2 p(cid:62)p
cannot be obtained using canonical Hamiltonian dynamics
for any choice of smooth Hamiltonian. (See Appendix).

3Note that the effect of a non-identity F matrix can be
achieved by simply composing these magnetic dynamics with a
coordinate-transformation as suggested in Lemma 3.

One further remark is that by construction the integrator for
magnetic HMC is expected to have similarly good energy
conservation properties to the integrator of standard HMC:

the canonical leapfrog integrator of standard HMC if the
Hamiltonian is separable. (See Appendix).
It is worthwhile to contrast the algorithmic differences be-
tween magnetic HMC and ordinary HMC. Intuitively, the
role of the ﬂow ΦA
(cid:15),H2(p) – which reduces to the standard
Euler translation update of ordinary HMC when G = 0
– is to introduce a rotation into the momentum space of
the ﬂow. In particular, a non-zero element Gij will allow
momentum to periodically ﬂow between pi and pj. If we
regard G as an element in the Lie algebra of antisymmet-
ric matrices, which can be thought of as inﬁnitesimal rota-
tions, then the exponential map exp(G(cid:15)) will project this
transformation into the Lie group of real orthogonal linear
maps.

With respect to computational cost, although magnetic
HMC requires matrix exponentiation/diagonalization to
simulate ΦA

In the Appendix we also display illustrations of different
MHMC proposals across several targets in order to provide
more intuition for MHMC’s dynamics. Further experimen-
tal details and an additional experiment on a Gaussian fun-
nel target are also provided in the Appendix.

6.1. Multiscale Gaussians

We consider two highly ill-conditioned Gaussians similar
to as in (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2014) to illustrate a heuristic
for G matrix selection and demonstrate properties of the
magnetic dynamics. In particular we consider a centered,
uncorrelated 2D Gaussian with covariance eigenvalues of
106 and 1 as well as a centered, uncorrelated 10D Gaus-
sian with two large covariance eigenvalues of 106 and re-
maining eigenvalues of 1. We denote their coordinates as
R10 respec-
R2 and x = (x1, . . . , x10)

large marginal variance since its exploration will often be
limited by the smaller variance directions. Accordingly, in
order to induce a periodic momentum ﬂow between the di-
rections of small and large variance, we introduce nonzero
components Gij into the subspaces spanned directly be-
tween the large and small eigenvalues. Indeed, we ﬁnd that
magnetic G term is encouraging more efﬁcient exploration
as we can see from the averaged autocorrelation of samples
generated from the HMC/MHMC chains – see Figure 2.
Further, by running the 50 parallel chains for 107 timesteps,
we computed both the bias and Monte Carlo standard errors
(MCSE) of the estimators of the target moments as shown
in Table 1 and Table 2.

“curl” into the dynamics that pushes the sampler across
the saddlepoint to the other mode allowing it to efﬁciently
mix around both modes and between them – see Figure

6.3. FitzHugh-Nagumo model

Finally, we consider the problem of Bayesian inference
over the parameters of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model (a set
of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, originally de-
veloped to model the behavior of axial spiking potentials
in neurons) as in (Ramsay et al., 2007; Girolami & Calder-
head, 2011). The FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a dynamical
system (V (t), R(t)) deﬁned by the following coupled dif-
ferential equations:

˙V (t) = c(V (t)
˙R(t) =

We consider the problem where the initial conditions

of noise-corrupted observations ( (cid:101)V (tn), (cid:101)R(tn))N

the true parameter values of the model from these observa-
tions, but we can obtain a posterior distribution over them
by specifying a model for the observation noise and a prior
distribution over the model parameters.

Similar to (Ramsay et al., 2007; Girolami & Calderhead,
2011), we assume that the observation noise variables

Importantly, the highly non-linear dependence of the tra-
jectory on the parameters a, b and c yields a complex pos-
terior distribution - see Figure 4. Full details of the model
set-up can be found in (Ramsay et al., 2007; Girolami &
Calderhead, 2011).

For our experiments, we used ﬁxed parameter settings of
a = 0.2, b = 0.2, c = 3.0 to generate 200 evenly-
spaced noise-corrupted observations over the time interval
t = [0, 20] (as in (Ramsay et al., 2007; Girolami & Calder-
head, 2011)). We performed inference over the posterior
distribution of parameters (a, b, c) with this set of observa-
tions using both the HMC and MHMC algorithms, which
was perturbed with a magnetic ﬁeld in each of the 3 ax-
ial planes of parameters – along the ab, ac, and bc axes
with magnitude g = 0.1. The chains were run to gener-

sponding acceptance rates) and details are included in the
Appendix for this example, demonstrating similar behav-
ior.

note that all methods achieved nearly perfect mixing over
the ﬁrst coordinate so their effective sample size were
truncated at 1000 for the a coordinate.
In this example,
we can see that all magnetic perturbations slightly increase
the mixing rate of the sampler over each of the (b, c)
coordinates with the ab perturbation performing best.

7. Discussion and Conclusion

We have investigated a framework for MCMC algorithms
based on non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics and have
given a construction for an explicit, symplectic integrator
that is used to implement a generalization of HMC we re-
fer to as magnetic HMC. We have also shown several ex-
amples where the non-canonical dynamics of MHMC can
improve upon the sampling performance of standard HMC.
Important directions for further research include ﬁnding
more automated, adaptive mechanisms to set the matrix G,
as well as investigating positionally-dependent magnetic
ﬁeld components, similar to how Riemannian HMC corre-
sponds to local preconditioning. We believe that exploiting
more general deterministic ﬂows (such as also maintaining
a non-zero E in the top left-block of a general A matrix)
could form a fruitful area for further research on MCMC
methods.
