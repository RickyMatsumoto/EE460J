1. Quotient Manifolds: Theory and Derivations

In the following, we ﬁrst provide some general theory about quotient manifolds, and then derive the quantities that are of
interest for our particular purpose.

1.1. Theory of Quotient Manifolds

Let Mp be a Riemannian manifold and G be a group acting on Mp, that is, G deﬁnes a mapping f : G × Mp → Mp.
The orbit of a point x ∈ Mp is the set of images of x under all elements of the group, i.e.,

Orb(x) = {f (g, x) : ∀g ∈ G} .

The action of group G deﬁnes a relation denoted by ∼ in the form x ∼ q : ∃g ∈ G s.t. q = f (g, x). Recall that a relation
∼ on a set X is said to be an equivalence relation iff ∀a, b, c ∈ X , a ∼ a (reﬂexive), a ∼ b ⇒ b ∼ a (symmetric) and if
a ∼ b and b ∼ c then a ∼ c(transitive). If the action of group G deﬁnes an equivalence relation, then under the conditions
of Theorem 1 below, the set of orbits denoted by Mp\G forms a smooth manifold.
Theorem 1 (Quotient Manifold Theorem). Suppose that a Lie group G acts smoothly, freely and properly on a smooth
manifold Mp. Then Mp\G is a topological manifold of dimension dim(Mp) − dim(G), and has a unique smooth
structure.

Proof. See Theorem 9.16 in (Lee, 2003).

Intuitively, a quotient manifold M (cid:44) Mp\G is formed by gluing points of Mp together using the equivalence relation
∼. Assuming that M is a smooth manifold, it is possible to make use of the structure of Mp to deﬁne the Riemannian
geometry of M, as discussed below. To this end, let us ﬁrst deﬁne the tangent space of a quotient manifold in general, and
then focus on the speciﬁc quotient manifold of interest in this work.

1.1.1. TANGENT SPACES.

The equivalence relation ∼ splits the tangent space of Mt at Ω into two complementary parts, namely the horizontal
space HΩMp and the vertical space VΩMp with respect to the metric gp(·, ·) on the original manifold Mp. That is,
TΩMp = HΩMp ⊕ VΩMp, with

HΩMp = {hΩ ∈ TΩMp : gp(hΩ, vΩ) = 0, ∀vΩ ∈ VΩMp} .

(1)

The tangent space of the quotient manifold is identiﬁed with the horizontal space of the original manifold, i.e., T[Ω]M (cid:44)
HΩMp. Once the horizontal space HΩMp is identiﬁed, a tangent vector on ξ[Ω] ∈ T[Ω]M can be uniquely represented

1.2. Derivations for our Speciﬁc Quotient Manifold
For the product manifold Mp (cid:44) St(p, n) × S p

++, the tangent space is given by

T(W ,M ) = TW St(p, n) × TM S p

++ .

This lets us deﬁne the Riemannian metric of the product manifold as

g(W ,M )((ξW , ξM ) , (ςW , ςM )) = 2 Tr(ξT

W ςW ) + Tr(M −1ξM M −1ςM ) .

The Riemannian gradient of such a space directly follows from the geometry of the Stiefel and SPD manifolds. That is, for
a smooth function fp (W , M ) : Mp → R, we have

grad fp =

∇W (fp) − W sym

Proof. M is a smooth manifold as a direct result of Theorem 9.16 in (Lee, 2003).
In particular, the mapping π :
(cid:0)W , M (cid:1) → (cid:0)W R, RT M R(cid:1) for R ∈ O(p) is smooth, free, as (cid:0)W , M (cid:1) = (cid:0)W R, RT M R(cid:1) iff R = Ip, and proper,
since the actions of compact Lie groups (O(p) here) are always proper. This concludes the proof.

Projecting onto the Horizontal Space

Let γ : t → (W R(t), R(t)T M R(t)), with R(t) ∈ Op, be a curve on Mp passing through (W , M ) at t = 0. The
vertical space at (W , M ) is given by ˙γ(t) evaluated at t = 0, which yields

with ΘT = −Θ ∈ Rp×p. As such,

˙γ(t)|t=0 = (W Θ, M Ω − ΘM ),

V(W ,M )Mp = {(W Θ, M Θ − ΘM ) : ΘT = −Θ ∈ Rp×p}.

A horizontal vector (ξW , ξM ) is then deﬁned by the condition

(cid:0)(ξW , ξM ), (W Θ, M Θ − ΘM )(cid:1) = 0 .

Since Θ is a skew-symmetric matrix, the above equality is satisﬁed iff 2ξT
is

Let (ξW , ξM ) ∈ T(W ,M )Mp be a tangent vector of the product manifold. Removing the vertical component results in
the horizontal vector (ξW − W Θ, ξM − M Θ + ΘM ) ∈ H(W ,M )M. As derived above, this vector should satisfy the
symmetry constraint of Eq. 7. To obtain Θ, we plug the horizontal vector (ξW − W Θ, ξM − M Θ + ΘM ) into Eq. 7,
which yields

2(ξW − W Θ)T W + M −1(ξM − M Θ + ΘM ) − (ξM − M Θ + ΘM )M −1

In other words, Θ can be obtained as the solution to a Sylvester equation.
Remark 1. To have more insights on the structure of M, it is useful to study the form of the tangent vectors on M. Since
both the Stiefel and SPD manifolds are homogeneous spaces, their geometry and hence the geometry of their product space
can be studied by analyzing their structure around any predeﬁned point. Choosing W = [Ip , 0p×(n−p)]T and following
the derivation above, it can be shown that the tangent vectors of M can be represented as

: V ∈ Sym(p), B ∈ R(n−p)×p

(cid:41)

with U ∈ On. In the form considered above, a basis for the horizontal subspace can be formed from bases derived from
B ∈ M (n−p)×p and V ∈ Sym(p). The basis elements for the V part are of the form

(cid:0)[V iM −1 − M −1V i; 0], V i
where the V i are basis elements for Sym(p). We note that this form of horizontal projection cannot be used in ﬁrst order
optimization techniques as the basis elements are not orthogonal.

Optimization on M

Given the deﬁnitions above, the only missing quantities to perform ﬁrst order optimization on M are the Euclidean gradi-
ents ∇W and ∇M of the cost function in Eq. 10 of the main paper. Deﬁning δi = xi − ˜xi, these gradients can be computed
as
