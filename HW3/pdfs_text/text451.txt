The Loss Surface of Deep and Wide Neural Networks

Quynh Nguyen 1 Matthias Hein 1

Abstract

While the optimization problem behind deep
neural networks is highly non-convex, it is fre-
quently observed in practice that training deep
networks seems possible without getting stuck in
suboptimal points. It has been argued that this
is the case as all local minima are close to be-
ing globally optimal. We show that this is (al-
most) true, in fact almost all local minima are
globally optimal, for a fully connected network
with squared loss and analytic activation func-
tion given that the number of hidden units of one
layer of the network is larger than the number
of training points and the network structure from
this layer on is pyramidal.

1. Introduction

The application of deep learning (LeCun et al., 2015) has
in recent years lead to a dramatic boost in performance in
many areas such as computer vision, speech recognition or
natural language processing. Despite this huge empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of deep learning is
still limited. In this paper we address the non-convex opti-
mization problem of training a feedforward neural network.
This problem turns out to be very difﬁcult as there can
be exponentially many distinct local minima (Auer et al.,
1996; Safran & Shamir, 2016). It has been shown that the
training of a network with a single neuron with a variety of
activation functions turns out to be NP-hard (Sima, 2002).

In practice local search techniques like stochastic gradient
descent or variants are used for training deep neural net-
works. Surprisingly, it has been observed (Dauphin et al.,
2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015) that in the training of state-
of-the-art feedforward neural networks with sparse con-
nectivity like convolutional neural networks (LeCun et al.,
1990; Krizhevsky et al., 2012) or fully connected ones one

does not encounter problems with suboptimal local min-
ima. However, as the authors admit themselves in (Good-
fellow et al., 2015), the reason for this might be that there
is a connection between the fact that these networks have
good performance and that they are easy to train.

On the theoretical side there have been several interesting
developments recently, see e.g.
(Brutzkus & Globerson,
2017; Lee et al., 2016; Poggio & Liao, 2017; Rister & Ru-
bin, 2017; Soudry & Hoffer, 2017; Zhou & Feng, 2017).
For some class of networks one can show that one can train
them globally optimal efﬁciently. However, it turns out that
these approaches are either not practical (Janzamin et al.,
2016; Haeffele & Vidal, 2015; Soltanolkotabi, 2017) as
they require e.g. knowledge about the data generating mea-
sure, or they modify the neural network structure and ob-
jective (Gautier et al., 2016). One class of networks which
are simpler to analyze are deep linear networks for which it
has been shown that every local minimum is a global min-
imum (Baldi & Hornik, 1988; Kawaguchi, 2016). While
this is a highly non-trivial result as the optimization prob-
lem is non-convex, deep linear networks are not interesting
in practice as one efﬁciently just learns a linear function. In
order to characterize the loss surface for general networks,
an interesting approach has been taken by (Choromanska
et al., 2015a). By randomizing the nonlinear part of a feed-
forward network with ReLU activation function and mak-
ing some additional simplifying assumptions, they can re-
late it to a certain spin glass model which one can analyze.
In this model the objective of local minima is close to the
global optimum and the number of bad local minima de-
creases quickly with the distance to the global optimum.
This is a very interesting result but is based on a number
of unrealistic assumptions (Choromanska et al., 2015b). It
has recently been shown (Kawaguchi, 2016) that if some of
these assumptions are dropped one basically recovers the
result of the linear case, but the model is still unrealistic.

In this paper we analyze the case of overspeciﬁed neural
networks, that is the network is larger than what is required
to achieve minimum training error. Under overspeciﬁca-
tion (Safran & Shamir, 2016) have recently analyzed under
which conditions it is possible to generate an initialization
so that it is in principle possible to reach the global opti-
mum with descent methods. However, they can only deal
with one hidden layer networks and have to make strong

The Loss Surface of Deep and Wide Neural Networks

assumptions on the data such as linear independence or
cluster structure. In this paper overspeciﬁcation means that
there exists a very wide layer, where the number of hid-
den units is larger than the number of training points. For
this case, we can show that a large class of local minima
is globally optimal. In fact, we will argue that almost ev-
ery critical point is globally optimal. Our results generalize
previous work of (Yu & Chen, 1995), who have analyzed a
similar setting for one hidden layer networks, to networks
of arbitrary depth. Moreover, it extends results of (Gori &
Tesi, 1992; Frasconi et al., 1997) who have shown that for
certain deep feedforward neural networks almost all local
minima are globally optimal whenever the training data is
linearly independent. While it is clear that our assumption
on the number of hidden units is quite strong, there are sev-
eral recent neural network structures which contain a quite
wide hidden layer relative to the number of training points
e.g. in (Lin et al., 2016) they have 50,000 training samples
and the network has one hidden layer with 10,000 hidden
units and (Ba & Caruana, 2014) have 1.1 million training
samples and a layer with 400,000 hidden units. We refer to
(Ciresan et al., 2010; Neyshabur et al., 2015; Vincent et al.,
2010; Caruana et al., 2001) for other examples where the
number of hidden units of one layer is on the order of the
number of training samples. We conjecture that for these
kind of wide networks it still holds that almost all local
minima are globally optimal. The reason is that one can
expect linear separability of the training data in the wide
layer. We provide supporting evidence for this conjecture
by showing that basically every critical point for which the
training data is linearly separable in the wide layer is glob-
ally optimal. Moreover, we want to emphasize that all of
our results hold for neural networks used in practice. There
are no simplifying assumptions as in previous work.

2. Feedforward Neural Networks and

Backpropagation

We are mainly concerned with multi-class problems but
our results also apply to multivariate regression problems.
Let N be the number of training samples and denote by
X = [x1, . . . , xN ]T ∈ RN ×d, Y = [y1, . . . , yN ]T ∈
RN ×m the input resp. output matrix for the training data
(xi, yi)N
i=1, where d is the input dimension and m the
number of classes. We consider fully-connected feedfor-
ward networks with L layers, indexed from 0, 1, 2, . . . , L,
which correspond to the input layer, 1st hidden layer, etc,
and output layer. The network structure is determined by
k=1 ∈ W := Rd×n1 × . . . ×
the weight matrices (Wk)L
Rnk−1×nk ×. . .×RnL−1×m; where nk is the number of hid-
den units of layer k (for consistency, we set n0 = d, nL =
k=1 ∈ B := Rn1 × . . . × RnL .
m), and the bias vectors (bk)L
We denote by P = W × B the space of all possible pa-
rameters of the network. In this paper, [a] denotes the set

of integers {1, 2, . . . , a} and [a, b] the set of integers from
a to b. The activation function σ : R → R is assumed at
least to be continuously differentiable, that is σ ∈ C 1(R).
In this paper, we assume that all the functions are applied
componentwise. Let fk, gk : Rd → Rnk be the mappings
from the input space to the feature space at layer k, which
are deﬁned as

f0(x) = x, fk(x) = σ(gk(x)), gk(x) = W T

k fk−1(x) + bk

for every k ∈ [L], x ∈ Rd. In the following, let Fk =
[fk(x1), fk(x2), . . . , fk(xN )]T ∈ RN ×nk and Gk =
[gk(x1), gk(x2), . . . , gk(xN )]T ∈ RN ×nk be the matrices
that store the feature vectors of layer k after and before ap-
plying the activation function. One can easily check that

F1 = σ(XW1 + 1N bT
1 ),
Fk = σ(Fk−1Wk + 1N bT

k ),

for k ∈ [2, L].

In this paper we analyze the behavior of the loss of the
network without any form of regularization, that is the ﬁnal
objective Φ : P → R of the network is deﬁned as

where l : R → R is assumed to be a continuously differ-
entiable loss function, that is l ∈ C 1(R). The prototype
loss which we consider in this paper is the squared loss,
l(α) = α2, which is one of the standard loss functions in
the neural network literature. We assume throughout this
paper that the minimum of (1) is attained.

The idea of backpropagation is the core of our theoretical
analysis. Lemma 2.1 below shows well-known relations for
feed-forward neural networks, which are used throughout
the paper. The derivative of the loss w.r.t.
the value of
unit j at layer k evaluated at a single training sample xi is
∂gkj (xi) . We arrange these vectors
denoted as δkj(xi) =
for all training samples into a single matrix ∆k, deﬁned as

∂Φ

∆k = [δk:(x1), . . . , δk:(xN )]T ∈ RN ×nk .

In the following, A ◦ B denotes the Hadamard product be-
tween two matrices, i.e. (A ◦ B)ij = AijBij.

Lemma 2.1 Let σ, l ∈ C 1(R). Then it holds

Note that Lemma 2.1 does not apply to non-differentiable
activation functions like the ReLU function, σReLU(x) =
max{0, x}. However, it is known that one can approxi-
mate this activation function arbitrarily well by a smooth
function e.g. σα(x) = 1
α log(1 + eαx) (a.k.a. softplus)
satisﬁes limα→∞ σα(x) = σReLU(x) for any x ∈ R.

3. Main Result

We ﬁrst discuss some prior work and present then our main
result together with extensive discussion. For improved
readability we postpone the proof of the main result to
the next section which contains several intermediate results
which are of independent interest.

3.1. Previous Work

Our work can be seen as a generalization of the work of
(Gori & Tesi, 1992; Yu & Chen, 1995). While (Yu & Chen,
1995) has shown that for a one-hidden layer network, that
if n1 = N − 1, then every local minimum is a global min-
imum, the work of (Gori & Tesi, 1992) considered also
multi-layer networks. For the convenience of the reader,
we ﬁrst restate Theorem 1 of (Gori & Tesi, 1992) using our
previously introduced notation. The critical points of a con-
tinuously differentiable function f : Rd → R are the points
where the gradient vanishes, that is ∇f (x) = 0. Note that
this is a necessary condition for a local minimum.

Theorem 3.1 (Gori & Tesi, 1992) Let Φ : P → R be
deﬁned as in (1) with least squares loss l(a) = a2. As-
sume σ : R → [d, ¯d] to be continuously differentiable with
strictly positive derivative and

Then every critical point (Wl, bl)L
the conditions

1. rank(Wl) = nl for all l ∈ [2, L],

2. [X, 1N ]T ∆1 = 0 implies ∆1 = 0

is a global minimum.

While this result is already for general multi-layer net-
works, the condition “[X, 1N ]T ∆1 = 0 implies ∆1 = 0” is
the main caveat. It is already noted in (Gori & Tesi, 1992),
that “it is quite hard to understand its practical meaning”
as it requires prior knowledge of ∆1 at every critical point.
Note that this is almost impossible as ∆1 depends on all
the weights of the network. For a particular case, when
the training samples (biases added) are linearly indepen-
dent, i.e. rank([X, 1N ]) = N , the condition holds auto-
matically. This case is discussed in the following Theorem

3.4, where we consider a more general class of loss and
activation functions.

3.2. First Main Result and Discussion

A function f : Rd → R is real analytic if the correspond-
ing multivariate Taylor series converges to f (x) on an open
subset of Rd (Krantz & Parks, 2002). All results in this
section are proven under the following assumptions on the
loss/activation function and training data.

Assumptions 3.2

1. There are no identical

training

samples, i.e. xi (cid:54)= xj for all i (cid:54)= j,

2. σ is analytic on R, strictly monotonically increasing

and

(a) σ is bounded or
(b) there are positive ρ1, ρ2, ρ3, ρ4, s.t.

|σ(t)| ≤
ρ1eρ2t for t < 0 and |σ(t)| ≤ ρ3t + ρ4 for t ≥ 0

3. l ∈ C 2(R) and if l(cid:48)(a) = 0 then a is a global minimum

These conditions are not always necessary to prove some of
the intermediate results presented below, but we decided to
provide the proof under the above strong assumptions for
better readability. For instance, all of our results also hold
for strictly monotonically decreasing activation functions.
Note that the above conditions are not restrictive as many
standard activation functions satisfy them.

Lemma 3.3 The sigmoid activation function σ1(t) =
1+e−t , the tangent hyperbolic σ2(t) = tanh(t) and the
softplus function σ3(t) = 1
α log(1 + eαt) for α > 0 satisfy
Assumption 3.2.

The conditions on l are satisﬁed for any twice continu-
ously differentiable convex loss function. A typical ex-
ample is the squared loss l(a) = a2 or the Pseudo-
Huber loss (Hartley & Zisserman, 2004) given as lδ(a) =
2δ2((cid:112)1 + a2/δ2 − 1) which approximates a2 for small
a and is linear with slope 2δ for large a. But also non-
convex loss functions satisfy this requirement, e.g.
the
Blake-Zisserman, corrupted Gaussian and Cauchy func-
tions (Hartley & Zisserman, 2004) (p.617-p.619).

As a motivation for our main result, we ﬁrst analyze the
case when the training samples are linearly independent,
which requires N ≤ d+1. It can be seen as a generalization
of Corollary 1 in (Gori & Tesi, 1992).

Theorem 3.4 Let Φ : P → R be deﬁned as in (1) and let
the Assumptions 3.2 hold. If the training samples are lin-
early independent, that is rank([X, 1N ]) = N , then every
critical point (Wl, bl)L
l=1 of Φ for which the weight matri-
ces (Wl)L
l=2 have full column rank, that is rank(Wl) = nl
for l ∈ [2, L], is a global minimum.

The Loss Surface of Deep and Wide Neural Networks

Theorem 3.4 implies that the weight matrices of potential
saddle points or suboptimal local minima need to have low
rank for one particular layer. Note however that the set
of low rank weight matrices in W has measure zero. At
the moment we cannot prove that suboptimal low rank lo-
cal minima cannot exist. However, it seems implausible
that such suboptimal low rank local minima exist as ev-
ery neighborhood of such points contains full rank matrices
which increase the expressiveness of the network. Thus it
should be possible to use this degree of freedom to further
reduce the loss, which contradicts the deﬁnition of a local
minimum. Thus we conjecture that all local minima are
indeed globally optimal.

The main restriction in the assumptions of Theorem 3.4 is
the linear independence of the training samples as it re-
quires N ≤ d + 1, which is very restrictive in practice. We
prove in this section a similar guarantee in our main The-
orem 3.8 by implicitly transporting this condition to some
higher layer. A similar guarantee has been proven by (Yu
& Chen, 1995) for a single hidden layer network, whereas
we consider general multi-layer networks. The main ingre-
dient of the proof of our main result is the observation in
the following lemma.

Lemma 3.5 Let Φ : P → R be deﬁned as in (1) and let
the Assumptions 3.2 hold. Let (Wl, bl)L
l=1 ∈ P be given.
Assume there is some k ∈ [L − 1] s.t. the following holds

1. rank([Fk, 1N ]) = N

2. rank(Wl) = nl, l ∈ [k + 2, L]

3. ∇Wk+1Φ

then (Wl, bl)L

l=1 is a global minimum.

The ﬁrst condition of Lemma 3.5 can be seen as a gener-
alization of the requirement of linearly independent train-
ing inputs in Theorem 3.4 to a condition of linear inde-
pendence of the feature vectors at a hidden layer. Lemma
3.5 suggests that if we want to make statements about the
global optimality of critical points, it is sufﬁcient to know
when and which critical points fulﬁll these conditions. The
third condition is trivially satisﬁed by a critical point and
the requirement of full column rank of the weight matrices
is similar to Theorem 3.4. However, the ﬁrst one may not
be fulﬁlled since rank([Fk, 1N ]) is dependent not only on
the weights but also on the architecture. The main difﬁculty
of the proof of our following main theorem is to prove that
this ﬁrst condition holds under the rather simple require-
ment that nk ≥ N − 1 for a subset of all critical points.

But before we state the theorem we have to discuss a par-
ticular notion of non-degenerate critical point.

Deﬁnition 3.6 (Block Hessian) Let f : D → R be a
twice-continuously differentiable function deﬁned on some
open domain D ⊆ Rn. The Hessian w.r.t. a subset of vari-
Sf (x) ∈ R|S|×|S|.
ables S ⊆ {x1, . . . , xn} is denoted as ∇2
When |S| = n, we write ∇2f (x) ∈ Rn×n to denote the full
Hessian matrix.

We use this to introduce a slightly more general notion of
non-degenerate critical point.

Deﬁnition 3.7 (Non-degenerate critical point) Let f
:
D → R be a twice-continuously differentiable function de-
ﬁned on some open domain D ⊆ Rn. Let x ∈ D be a
critical point, i.e. ∇f (x) = 0, then

• x is non-degenerate for a subset of variables S ⊆

{x1, . . . , xn} if ∇2

Sf (x) is non-singular.

• x is non-degenerate if ∇2f (x) is non-singular.

Note that a non-degenerate critical point might not be non-
degenerate for a subset of variables, and vice versa, if it is
non-degenerate on a subset of variables it does not neces-
sarily imply non-degeneracy on the whole set. For instance,

∇2f (x) =

, ∇2f (y) =

Clearly, det ∇2f (x) = 0 but det ∇2
{x1,x2}f (x) (cid:54)= 0, and
det ∇2f (y) (cid:54)= 0 but det ∇2
{y3,y4}f (y) = 0. The concept
of non-degeneracy on a subset of variables is crucial for
the following statement of our main result.

Theorem 3.8 Let Φ : P → R be deﬁned as in (1) and let
the Assumptions 3.2 hold. Suppose nk ≥ N − 1 for some
k ∈ [L − 1]. Then every critical point (W ∗
l=1 of Φ
which satisﬁes the following conditions

l , b∗

l )L

1. (W ∗

l , b∗

l )L

l=1 is non-degenerate on {(Wl, bl) | l ∈ I},
for some subset I ⊆ {k + 1, . . . , L} satisfying
{k + 1} ∈ I,

2. (W ∗

l )L

l=k+2 has full column rank, that is, rank(W ∗

l ) =

nl for l ∈ [k + 2, L],

is a global minimum of Φ.

First of all we note that the full column rank condition of
(Wl)L
l=k+2 in Theorem 3.4, and 3.8 implicitly requires that
nk+1 ≥ nk+2 ≥ . . . ≥ nL. This means the network needs
to have a pyramidal structure from layer k + 2 to L. It is
interesting to note that most modern neural network archi-
tectures have a pyramidal structure from some layer, typi-
cally the ﬁrst hidden layer, on. Thus this is not a restrictive

The Loss Surface of Deep and Wide Neural Networks

requirement. Indeed, one can even argue that Theorem 3.8
gives an implicit justiﬁcation as it hints on the fact that such
networks are easy to train if one layer is sufﬁciently wide.

Note that Theorem 3.8 does not
require fully non-
degenerate critical points but non-degeneracy is only
needed for some subset of variables that includes layer
k + 1. As a consequence of Theorem 3.8, we get directly a
stronger result for non-degenerate local minima.

Corollary 3.9 Let Φ : P → R be deﬁned as in (1) and let
the Assumptions 3.2 hold. Suppose nk ≥ N − 1 for some
k ∈ [L − 1]. Then every non-degenerate local minimum
(W ∗
l=k+2 has full column
rank, that is rank(W ∗

l=1 of Φ for which (W ∗

l ) = nl, is a global minimum of Φ.

l , b∗

l )L

l )L

Let us discuss the implications of these results. First, note
that Theorem 3.8 is slightly weaker than Theorem 3.4 as it
requires also non-degeneracy wrt to a set of variables in-
cluding layer k + 1. Moreover, similar to Theorem 3.4 it
does not exclude the possibility of suboptimal local min-
ima of low rank in the layers “above” layer k + 1. On the
other hand it makes also very strong statements. In fact, if
nk ≥ N − 1 for some k ∈ [L − 1] then even degenerate
saddle points/local maxima are excluded as long as they
are non-degenerate with respect to any subset of parame-
ters of upper layers that include layer k + 1 and the rank
condition holds. Thus given that the weight matrices of the
upper layers have full column rank , there is not much room
left for degenerate saddle points/local maxima. Moreover,
for a one-hidden-layer network for which n1 ≥ N − 1,
every non-degenerate critical point with respect to the out-
put layer parameters is a global minimum, as the full rank
condition is not active for one-hidden layer networks.

Concerning the non-degeneracy condition of main Theo-
rem 3.8, one might ask how likely it is to encounter degen-
erate points of a smooth function. This is answered by an
application of Sard’s/Morse theorem in (Milnor, 1965).

Theorem 3.10 (A. Morse, p.11) If f : U ⊂ Rd → R is
twice continuously differentiable. Then for almost all w ∈
Rd with respect to the Lebesgue measure it holds that f (cid:48)
deﬁned as f (cid:48)(x) = f (x) + (cid:104)w, x(cid:105) has only non-degenerate
critical points.

Note that the theorem would still hold if one would draw
w uniformly at random from the set {z ∈ Rd | (cid:107)z(cid:107)2 ≤ (cid:15)}
for any (cid:15) > 0. Thus almost every linear perturbation f (cid:48) of
a function f will lead to the fact all of its critical points are
non-degenerate. Thus, this result indicates that exact de-
generate points might be rare. Note however that in prac-
tice the Hessian at critical points can be close to singular
(at least up to numerical precision), which might affect the
training of neural networks negatively (Sagun et al., 2016).

As we argued for Theorem 3.4 our main Theorem 3.8 does

not exclude the possibility of suboptimal degenerate local
minima or suboptimal local minima of low rank. However,
we conjecture that the second case cannot happen as ev-
ery neighborhood of the local minima contains full rank
matrices which increase the expressiveness of the network
and this additional ﬂexibility can be used to reduce the loss
which contradicts the deﬁnition of a local minimum.

As mentioned in the introduction the condition nk ≥ N −1
looks at ﬁrst sight very strong. However, as mentioned in
the introduction, in practice often networks are used where
one hidden layer is rather wide, that is nk is on the order of
N (typically it is the ﬁrst layer of the network). As the con-
dition of Theorem 3.8 is sufﬁcient and not necessary, one
can expect out of continuity reasons that the loss surface of
networks where the condition is approximately true, is still
rather well behaved, in the sense that still most local min-
ima are indeed globally optimal and the suboptimal ones
are not far away from the globally optimal ones.

4. Proof of Main Result

For better readability, we ﬁrst prove our main Theorem 3.8
for a special case where I is the whole set of upper layers,
i.e. I = {k + 1, . . . , L} , and then show how to extend
the proof to the general case where I ⊆ {k + 1, . . . , L} .
Our proof strategy is as follows. We ﬁrst show that the
output of each layer are real analytic functions of network
parameters. Then we prove that there exists a set of pa-
rameters such that rank([Fk, 1N ]) = N. Using proper-
ties of real analytic functions, we conclude that the set
of parameters where rank([Fk, 1N ]) < N has measure
zero. Then with the non-degeneracy condition, we can ap-
ply the implicit-function theorem to conclude that even if
rank([Fk, 1N ]) = N is not true at a critical point, then still
in any neighborhood of it there exists a point where the
conditions of Lemma 3.5 are true and the loss is minimal.
By continuity of Φ, this implies that the loss must also be
minimal at the critical point.

We introduce some notation frequently used in the proofs.
Let B(x, r) = {z ∈ Rd | (cid:107)x − z(cid:107)2 < r} be the open ball
in Rd of radius r around x.

Lemma 4.1 If the Assumptions 3.2 hold, then the output of
each layer fl for every l ∈ [L] are real analytic functions
of the network parameters on P.

Proof:
Any linear function is real analytic and the
set of real analytic functions is closed under addition,
multiplication and composition, see e.g. Prop. 2.2.2 and
Prop. 2.2.8 in (Krantz & Parks, 2002). As we assume
that the activation function is real analytic, we get that
all the output functions of the neural network fk are real
analytic functions of the parameters as compositions of
(cid:50)
real analytic functions.

The concept of real analytic functions is important in our
proofs as these functions can never be “constant” in a set of
the parameter space which has positive measure unless they
are constant everywhere. This is captured by the following
lemma.

Lemma 4.2 (Nguyen, 2015; Mityagin, 2015) If f : Rn →
R is a real analytic function which is not identically zero
then the set {x ∈ Rn | f (x) = 0} has Lebesgue measure
zero.

In the next lemma we show that there exist network param-
eters such that rank([Fk, 1N ]) = N holds if nk ≥ N − 1.
Note that this is only possible due to the fact that one uses
non-linear activation functions. For deep linear networks,
it is not possible for Fk to achieve maximum rank if the
layers below it are not sufﬁciently wide. To see this, one
considers Fk = Fk−1Wk + 1N bT
k for a linear network,
then rank(Fk) ≤ min{rank(Fk−1), rank(Wk)} + 1 since
the addition of a rank-one term does not increase the rank
of a matrix by more than one. By using induction, one gets
rank(Fk) ≤ rank(Wl) + k − l + 1 for every l ∈ [k].

Now we combine the previous lemma with Lemma 4.2 to
conclude the following.

We conclude that for nk ≥ N − 1 even if there are net-

neighborhood of these parameters contains network param-

The ﬁnal proof of our main Theorem 3.8 is heavily based
on the implicit function theorem, see e.g. (Marsden, 1974).

Theorem 4.6 Let Ψ : Rs × Rt → Rt be a continuously
differentiable function. Suppose (u0, v0) ∈ Rs × Rt and
Ψ(u0, v0) = 0. If the Jacobian matrix w.r.t. v,

is non-singular at (u0, v0),
then there is an open ball
B(u0, (cid:15)) for some (cid:15) > 0 and a unique function α :
B(u0, (cid:15)) → Rt such that Ψ(u, α(u)) = 0 for all u ∈
B(u0, (cid:15)). Furthermore, α is continuously differentiable.

With all the intermediate results proven above, we are ﬁ-
nally ready for the proof of the main result.

Proof of Theorem 3.8 for case I = {k + 1, . . . , L}
Let us divide the set of all parameters of the network
into two subsets where one corresponds to all param-
eters of all layers up to k, for that we denote u =
[vec(W1)T , bT
k ]T , and the other corre-
sponds to the remaining parameters, for that we denote
L]T . By abuse

of notation, we write Φ(u, v) to denote Φ
Let s = dim(u), t = dim(v) and (u∗, v∗) ∈ Rs ×Rt be the
corresponding vectors for the critical point (W ∗
l=1.
Let Ψ : Rs × Rt → Rt be a map deﬁned as Ψ(u, v) =
∇vΦ(u, v) ∈ Rt, which is the gradient mapping of Φ
w.r.t. all parameters of the upper layers from (k + 1) to
L. Since the gradient vanishes at a critical point, it holds
that Ψ(u∗, v∗) = ∇vΦ(u∗, v∗) = 0. The Jacobian of Ψ
w.r.t. v is the principal submatrix of the Hessian of Φ w.r.t.
vΦ(u, v) ∈ Rt×t. As the crit-
v, that is, JvΨ(u, v) = ∇2
ical point is assumed to be non-degenerate with respect
to v, it holds that JvΨ(u∗, v∗) = ∇2
vΦ(u∗, v∗) is non-
singular. Moreover, Ψ is continuously differentiable since
Φ ∈ C 2(P) due to Assumption 3.2. Therefore, Ψ and
(u∗, v∗) satisfy the conditions of the implicit function the-
orem 4.6. Thus there exists an open ball B(u∗, δ1) ⊂ Rs
for some δ1 > 0 and a continuously differentiable function
α : B(u∗, δ1) → Rt such that

exists a sufﬁciently small (cid:15) such that for any v ∈ B(v∗, (cid:15)),
the weight matrix part (Wl)L
l=k+2 of v has full column
rank. In particular, this, combined with the continuity of
α, implies that for a potentially smaller 0 < δ2 ≤ δ1, it
holds for all u ∈ B(u∗, δ2) that

Ψ(u, α(u)) = 0, α(u∗) = v∗,

and that the weight matrix part (Wl)L
has full column rank.

l=k+2 of α(u) ∈ Rt

Now, by Corollary 4.5 for any 0 < δ3 ≤ δ2 there exists a
˜u ∈ B(u∗, δ3) such that the generated output matrix ˜Fk at
layer k of the corresponding network parameters of ˜u satis-
ﬁes rank([ ˜Fk, 1N ]) = N. Moreover, it holds for ˜v = α(˜u)
that Ψ(˜u, ˜v) = 0 and the weight matrix part ( ˜Wl)L
l=k+2 of
˜v has full column rank. Assume (˜u, ˜v) corresponds to the
following representation

We obtain the following

Thus, Lemma 3.5 implies that ( ˜Wl, ˜bl)L

mum of Φ. Let p∗ = Φ
= Φ(˜u, ˜v). Note that
this construction can be done for any δ3 ∈ (0, δ2]. In par-
ticular, let (γr)∞
r=1 be a strictly monotonically decreasing
sequence such that γ1 = δ3 and limr→∞ γr = 0. By Corol-
lary 4.5 and the previous argument, we can choose for any
γr > 0 a point ˜ur ∈ B(u∗, γr) such that ˜vr = α(˜ur) has
full rank and Φ(˜ur, ˜vr) = p∗. Moreover, as limr→∞ γr =
0, it follows that limr→∞ ˜ur = u∗ and as α is a continu-
ous function, it holds with ˜vr = α(˜ur) that limr→∞ ˜vr =
limr→∞ α(˜ur) = α(limr→∞ ˜ur) = α(u∗) = v∗. Thus we
get limr→∞(˜ur, ˜vr) = (u∗, v∗) and as Φ is a continuous
function it holds

Proof of Theorem 3.8 for general case
In the general case I ⊆ {k + 1, . . . , L}, the previous proof
can be easily adapted. The idea is that we ﬁx all layers in

5. Relaxing the Condition on the Number of

Hidden Units

We have seen that nk ≥ N − 1 is a sufﬁcient condi-
tion which leads to a rather simple structure of the critical
points, in the sense that all local minima which have full
rank in the layers k + 2 to L and for which the Hessian is
non-degenerate on any subset of upper layers that includes
layer k + 1 are automatically globally optimal. This sug-
gests that suboptimal locally optimal points are either com-
pletely absent or relatively rare. We have motivated before
that networks with a certain wide layer are used in prac-
tice, which shows that the condition nk ≥ N − 1 is not
completely unrealistic. On the other hand we want to dis-
cuss in this section how it could be potentially relaxed. The
following result will provide some intuition about the case
nk < N − 1, but will not be as strong as our main result
3.8 which makes statements about a large class of critical
points. The main idea is that with the condition nk ≥ N −1
the data is linearly separable at layer k. As modern neural
networks are expressive enough to represent any function,
see (Zhang et al., 2017) for an interesting discussion on
this, one can expect that in some layer the training data be-
comes linearly separable. We prove that any critical point,
for which the “learned” network outputs at any layer are
linearly separable (see Deﬁnition 5.1) is a global minimum
of the training error.

In this section, we use a slightly different loss function than
in the previous section. The reason is that the standard least
squares loss is not necessarily small when the data is lin-
early separable. Let C1, . . . , Cm denote m classes. We

where l1, l2 penalize the deviation from the label encoding
for the true class resp. wrong classes. We assume that the
minimum of Φ is attained over P. Note that Φ is bounded
from below by zero as l1 and l2 are non-negative loss func-
tions. The results of this section are made under the follow-
ing assumptions on the activation and loss function.

Assumptions 5.2

1. σ ∈ C 1(R) and strictly monotoni-

cally increasing.

2. l1 : R → R+, l1 ∈ C 1, l1(a) = 0 ⇔ a ≥ 0, l(cid:48)

1(a) =

0 ⇔ a ≥ 0 and l(cid:48)

2(a) =

0 ⇔ a ≤ 0 and l(cid:48)

2(a) > 0 ∀ a > 0

In classiﬁcation tasks, this loss function encourages higher
values for the true class and lower values for wrong classes.
An example of the loss function that satisﬁes Assumption
5.2 is given as (see Figure 1):

l1(a) =

a ≥ 0

l2(a) =

which is similar to the truncated squared loss (also called
squared hinge loss) used in the SVM for binary classiﬁca-
tion. Since σ and l are continuously differentiable, all the
results from Lemma 2.1 still hold. Our main result in this
section is stated as follows.

Theorem 5.3 Let Φ : P → R+ be deﬁned as in (2) and let
the Assumptions 5.2 hold. Then it follows:

1. Every critical point of Φ for which the feature vectors
contained in the rows of Fk are linearly separable and
all the weight matrices (Wl)L
l=k+2 have full column
rank is a global minimum.

2. If the training inputs are linearly separable then every
critical point of Φ for which all the weight matrices
(Wl)L
l=2 have full column rank is a global minimum.

Note that the second statement of Theorem 5.3 can be con-
sidered as a special case of the ﬁrst statement. In the case
where L = 2 and training inputs are linearly separable, the
second statement of our Theorem 5.3 recovers the similar
result of (Gori & Tesi, 1992; Frasconi et al., 1997) for one-
hidden layer networks.

Even though the assumptions of Theorem 3.4 and Theo-
rem 5.3 are different in terms of class of activation and loss
functions, their results are related. In fact, it is well known
that if a set of vectors is linearly independent then they are
linearly separable, see e.g. p.340 (Barber, 2012). Thus
Theorem 5.3 can be seen as a direct generalization of The-
orem 3.4. The caveat, which is also the main difference to
Theorem 3.8, is that Theorem 5.3 makes only statements
for all the critical points for which the problem has become
separable at some layer, whereas there is no such condition
in Theorem 3.8. However, we still think that the result is
of practical relevance, as one can expect for a sufﬁciently
large network that stochastic gradient descent will lead to
a network structure where the data becomes separable at a
particular layer. When this happens all the associated criti-
cal points are globally optimal. It is an interesting question
for further research if one can show directly under some
architecture condition that the network outputs become lin-
early separable at some layer for any local minimum and
thus every local minimum is a global minimum.

6. Discussion

the loss surface becomes well-
Our results show that
behaved when there is a wide layer in the network.
Im-
plicitly, such a wide layer is often present in convolutional
neural networks used in computer vision. It is thus an in-
teresting future research question how and if our result can
be generalized to neural networks with sparse connectiv-
ity. We think that the results presented in this paper are a
signiﬁcant addition to the recent understanding why deep
learning works so efﬁciently. In particular, since in this pa-
per we are directly working with the neural networks used
in practice without any modiﬁcations or simpliﬁcations.
