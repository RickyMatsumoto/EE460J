Unimodal Probability Distributions for Deep Ordinal Classiﬁcation

Christopher Beckham 1 Christopher Pal 1

Abstract

Probability distributions produced by the cross-
entropy loss for ordinal classiﬁcation problems
can possess undesired properties. We propose
a straightforward technique to constrain discrete
ordinal probability distributions to be unimodal
via the use of the Poisson and binomial proba-
bility distributions. We evaluate this approach in
the context of deep learning on two large ordinal
image datasets, obtaining promising results.

1. Introduction

Ordinal classiﬁcation (sometimes called ordinal regression)
is a prediction task in which the classes to be predicted are
discrete and ordered in some fashion. This is different from
discrete classiﬁcation in which the classes are not ordered,
and different from regression in that we typically do not
know the distances between the classes (unlike regression,
in which we know the distances because the predictions lie
on the real number line). Some examples of ordinal clas-
siﬁcation tasks include predicting the stages of disease for
a cancer (Gentry et al., 2015), predicting what star rating
a user gave to a movie (Koren & Sill, 2011), or predicting
the age of a person (Eidinger et al., 2014).

Two of the easiest techniques used to deal with ordinal
problems include either treating the problem as a discrete
classiﬁcation and minimising the cross-entropy loss, or
treating the problem as a regression and using the squared
error loss. The former ignores the inherent ordering be-
tween the classes, while the latter takes into account the
distances between them (due to the square in the error term)
but assumes that the labels are actually real-valued – that
is, adjacent classes are equally distant. Furthermore, the
cross-entropy loss – under a one-hot target encoding – is
formulated such that it only ‘cares’ about the ground truth
class, and that probability estimates corresponding to the

other classes may not necessarily make sense in context.
We present an example of this in Figure 1, showing three
probability distributions: A, B, and C, all conditioned on
some input image. Highlighted in orange is the ground
the image is of an adult), and all probability
truth (i.e.
distributions have identical cross-entropy: this is because
the loss only takes into account the ground truth class,
− log(p(y|x)c), where c = adult, and all three distribu-
tions have the same probability mass for the adult class.

Despite all distributions having the same cross-entropy
loss, some distributions are ‘better’ than others. For ex-
ample, between A and B, A is preferred, since B puts an
unusually high mass on the baby class. However, A and
B are both unusual, because the probability mass does not
gradually decrease to the left and right of the ground truth.
In other words, it seems unusual to place more conﬁdence
on ‘schooler’ than ‘teen’ (distribution A) considering that
a teenager looks more like an adult than a schooler, and
it seems unusual to place more conﬁdence on ’baby’ than
’teen’ considering that again, a teenager looks more like an
adult than a baby. Distribution C makes the most sense be-
cause the probability mass gradually decreases as we move
further away from the most conﬁdent class. In this paper,
we propose a simple method to enforce this constraint, util-
ising the probability mass function of either the Poisson or
binomial distribution.

For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to distribu-
tions like C as ‘unimodal’ distributions; that is, distribu-
tions where the probability mass gradually decreases on
both sides of the class that has the majority of the mass.

1.1. Related work

Our work is inspired by the recent work of Hou et al.
(2016), who shed light on the issues associated with differ-
ent probability distributions having the same cross-entropy
loss for ordinal problems. In their work, they alleviate this
issue by minimising the ‘Earth mover’s distance’, which is
deﬁned as the minimum cost needed to transform one prob-
ability distribution to another. Because this metric takes
into account the distances between classes – moving prob-
ability mass to a far-away class incurs a large cost – the
metric is appropriate to minimise for an ordinal problem. It
turns out that in the case of an ordinal problem, the Earth

ity distribution, and K the number of classes. The authors
evaluate the EMD loss on two age estimation and one aes-
thetic estimation dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results.
However, the authors do not show comparisons between the
probability distributions learned between EMD and cross-
entropy.

Unimodality has been explored for ordinal neural networks
in da Costa et al. (2008). They explored the use of the bi-
nomial and Poisson distributions and a non-parametric way
of enforcing unimodal probability distributions (which we
do not explore). One key difference between their work
and ours here is that we evaluate these unimodal distribu-
tions in the context of deep learning, where the datasets are
generally much larger and have more variability; however,
there are numerous other differences which we will high-
light throughout this paper.

Beckham & Pal (2016) explored a loss function with an
intermediate form between a cross-entropy and regression
loss. In their work the squared error loss is still used, but a
probability distribution over classes is still learned. This is
done by adding a regression layer (i.e. a one-unit layer) at
the top of what would normally be the classiﬁcation layer,
p(y|x). Instead of learning the weight vector a it is ﬁxed
to [0, . . . , K − 1]T and the squared error loss is minimised.
This can be interpreted as drawing the class label from a
Gaussian distribution p(c|x) = N (c; E[a]p(y|x), σ2). This
technique was evaluated against the diabetic retinopathy
dataset and beat most of the baselines employed.
Inter-
estingly, since p(c|x) is a Gaussian, this is also unimodal,

though it is a somewhat odd formulation as it assumes c is
continuous when it is really discrete.

Cheng (2007) proposed the use of binary cross-entropy or
squared error on an ordinal encoding scheme rather than the
one-hot encoding which is commonly used in discrete clas-
siﬁcation. For example, if we have K classes, then we have
labels of length K − 1, where the ﬁrst class is [0, . . . , 0],
second class is [1, . . . , 0], third class is [1, 1, . . . , 0] and so
forth. With this formulation, we can think of the i’th output
unit as computing the cumulative probability p(y > i|x),
where i ∈ {0, . . . , K − 2}. Frank & Hall (2001) also
proposed this scheme but in a more general sense by us-
ing multiple classiﬁers (not just neural networks) to model
each cumulative probability, and Niu et al. (2016) proposed
a similar scheme using CNNs for age estimation. This
technique however suffers from the issue that the cumu-
lative probabilities p(y > 0 | x), . . . , p(y > K − 2 | x)
are not guaranteed to be monotonically decreasing, which
means that if we compute the discrete probabilities p(y =
0 | x), . . . , p(y = K − 1 | x) these are not guaranteed
to be strictly positive. To address the monotonicity issue,
Schapire et al. (2002) proposed a heuristic solution.

The proportional odds
model (POM) and its neural network extensions (POMNN,
CHNN (Guti´errez et al., 2014)) do not suffer from the
monotonicity issue due to the utilization of monotonically
increasing biases in the calculation of probabilities. The
stick-breaking approach by Khan et al. (2012), which is
a reformulation of the multinomial logit (softmax), could
also be used in the ordinal case as it technically imposes an
ordering on classes.

1.2. Poisson distribution

The Poisson distribution is commonly used to model the
probability of the number of events, k ∈ N ∪ 0 occurring
in a particular interval of time. The average frequency of
these events is denoted by λ ∈ R+. The probability mass
function is deﬁned as:

p(k; λ) =

λk exp(−λ)
k!

,

where 0 ≤ k ≤ K − 1. While we are not actually using
this distribution to model the occurrence of events, we can
make use of its probability mass function (PMF) to enforce
discrete unimodal probability distributions. For a purely
technical reason, we instead deal with the log of the PMF:

log

(cid:104) λkexp(−λ)
k!

(cid:105)

= log(λkexp(−λ)) − log(k!)

= log(λk) + log(exp(−λ)) − log(k!)
= k log(λ) − λ − log(k!).

(2)

(3)

If we let f (x) denote the scalar output of our deep net
(where f (x) > 0 which can be enforced with the softplus
nonlinearity), then we denote h(x)j to be:

j log(f (x)) − f (x) − log(j!),

(4)

where we have simply replaced the λ in equation (3) with
f (x). Then, p(y = j|x) is simply a softmax over h(x):

p(y = j|x) =

exp(−h(x)j/τ )
i=1 exp(−h(x)i/τ )

,

(cid:80)K

(5)

which is required since the support of the Poisson is in-
ﬁnite. We have also introduced a hyperparameter to the
softmax, τ , to control the relative magnitudes of each value
of p(y = j|x) (i.e., the variance of the distribution). Note
that as τ → ∞, the probability distribution becomes more
uniform, and as τ → 0, the distribution becomes more
‘one-hot’ like with respect to the class with the largest pre-
softmax value. We can illustrate this technique in terms of
the layers at the end of the deep network, which is shown
in Figure 2.

We note that the term in equation (4) can be re-arranged
and simpliﬁed to

h(x)j = j log(f (x)) − f (x) − log(j!)
= −f (x) + j log(f (x)) − log(j!)
= −f (x) + bj(f (x)).

(6)

In this form, we can see that the probability of class j is de-
termined by the scalar term f (x) and a bias term that also
depends on f (x). Another technique that uses biases to de-
termine class probabilities is the proportional odds model

Figure 2. The ﬁrst layer after f (x) is a ‘copy’ layer, that is,
f (x) = f (x)1 = · · · = f (x)K . The second layer applies the
log Poisson PMF transform followed by the softmax layer.

(POM), also called the ordered logit (McCullagh, 1980),
where the cumulative probability of a class depends on a
learned bias:

p(y ≤ j | x) = sigm(f (x) − bj),

(7)

where b1 < · · · < bK. Unlike our technique however, the
bias vector b is not a function of x nor f (x), but a ﬁxed
vector that is learned during training, which is interesting.
Furthermore, probability distributions computed using this
technique are not guaranteed to be unimodal.

Figure 5 shows the resulting probability distributions for
values of f (x) ∈ [0.1, 4.85] when τ = 1.0 and τ = 0.3.
We can see that all distributions are unimodal and that by
gradually increasing f (x) we gradually change which class
has the most mass associated with itself. The τ is also
an important parameter to tune as it alters the variance
of the distribution. For example, in Figure 5(a), we can
see that if we are conﬁdent in predicting the second class,
f (x) should be ∼ 2.6, though in this case the other classes
receive almost just as much probability mass.
If we set
τ = 0.3 however (Figure 5(b)), at f (x) = 2.6 the second
class has relatively more mass, which is to say we are even
more conﬁdent that this is the correct class. An unfortunate
side effect of using the Poisson distribution is that the vari-
ance is equivalent to the mean, λ. This means that in the
case of a large number of classes probability mass will be
widely distributed, and this can be seen in the K = 8 case
in Figure 6. While careful selection of τ can mitigate this,
we also use this problem to motivate the use of the binomial
distribution.

In the work of da Costa et al. (2008), they address the in-
ﬁnite support problem by using a ‘right-truncated’ Poisson
distribution. In this formulation, they simply ﬁnd the nor-
malization constant such that the probabilities sum to one.
This is almost equivalent to what we do, since we use a
softmax, although the softmax exponentiates its inputs and
we also introduce the temperature parameter τ to control
for the variance of the distribution.

1.3. Binomial distribution

The binomial distribution is used to model the probability
of a given number of ‘successes’ out of a given number of
trials and some success probability. The probability mass
function for this distribution – for k successes (where 0 ≤
k ≤ K − 1), given K − 1 trials and success probability p –
is:

p(k; K − 1, p) =

pk(1 − p)K−1−k

(cid:19)

(cid:18)K − 1
k

In the context of applying this to a neural network, k de-
notes the class we wish to predict, K − 1 denotes the num-
ber of classes (minus one since we index from zero), and
p = f (x) ∈ [0, 1] is the output of the network that we wish
to estimate. While no normalisation is theoretically needed
since the binomial distribution’s support is ﬁnite, we still
had to take the log of the PMF and normalise with a soft-
max to address numeric stability issues. This means the
resulting network is equivalent to that shown in Figure 2,
but with the log binomial PMF instead of Poisson. Just like
with the Poisson formulation, we can introduce the tem-
perature term τ into the resulting softmax to control for the
variance of the resulting distribution.

Figure 8 shows the resulting distributions achieved by vary-
ing p for when K = 4 and K = 8.

2. Methods and Results

In this section we go into details of our experiments, in-
cluding the datasets used and the precise architectures.

2.1. Data

We make use of two ordinal datasets appropriate for deep
neural networks:

• Diabetic retinopathy1. This is a dataset consisting
of extremely high-resolution fundus image data. The
training set consists of 17,563 pairs of images (where
a pair consists of a left and right eye image corre-
sponding to a patient).
In this dataset, we try and
predict from ﬁve levels of diabetic retinopathy: no
DR (25,810 images), mild DR (2,443 images), mod-
erate DR (5,292 images), severe DR (873 images), or
proliferative DR (708 images). A validation set is set
aside, consisting of 10% of the patients in the training
set. The images are pre-processed using the technique
proposed by competition winner Graham (2015) and
subsequently resized to 256px width and height.

• The Adience face dataset2 (Eidinger et al., 2014). This
dataset consists of 26,580 faces belonging to 2,284

2http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/Adience/data.html

subjects. We use the form of the dataset where faces
have been pre-cropped and aligned. We further pre-
process the dataset so that the images are 256px in
width and height. The training set consists of merg-
ing the ﬁrst four cross-validation folds together (the
last cross-validation fold is the test set), which com-
prises a total of 15,554 images. From this, 10% of the
images are held out as part of a validation set.

2.2. Network

We make use of a modest ResNet (He et al., 2015) architec-
ture to conduct our experiments. Table 1 describes the ex-
act architecture. We use the ReLU nonlinearity and HeNor-
mal initialization throughout the network.

Table 1. Description of the ResNet architecture used in the exper-
iments. For convolution, WxH@FsS = ﬁlter size of dimension W
x H, with F feature maps, and a stride of S. For average pooling,
WxHsS = a pool size of dimension W x H with a stride of S. This
architecture comprises a total of 4,307,840 learnable parameters.

We conduct the following experiments for both DR and
Adience datasets:

• (Baseline) cross-entropy loss. This simply corre-
sponds to a softmax layer for K classes at the end of
the average pooling layer in Table 1. For Adience and
DR, this corresponds to a network with 4,309,896 and
4,309,125 learnable parameters, respectively.

• (Baseline) squared-error loss. Rather than regress
f (x) against y, we regress with (K − 1)sigm(f (x)),
since we have observed better results with this formu-
lation in the past. For Adience and DR, this corre-
sponds t 4,309,905 and 4,309,131 learnable parame-
ters, respectively.

• Cross-entropy loss using the Poisson and binomial ex-
tensions at the end of the architecture (see Figure 2).
For Adience and DR, this corresponds to 4,308,097
learnable parameters for both. Although da Costa

Unimodal Probability Distributions for Deep Ordinal Classiﬁcation

et al. (2008) mention that cross-entropy or squared er-
ror can be used, their equations assume a squared er-
ror between the (one-hot encoded) ground truth and
p(y|x), whereas we use cross-entropy.

employed where we manually divide the learning rate by 10
when either the validation loss or valid set QWK plateaus
(whichever plateaus last) down to a minimum of 10−4 for
Adience and 10−5 for DR.4

• EMD loss (equation 1) where (cid:96) = 2 (i.e. Euclidean
norm) and the entire term is squared (to get rid of the
square root induced by the norm) using Poisson and
binomial extensions at the end of architecture. Again,
this corresponds to 4,308,097 learnable parameters for
both networks.

Amongst these experiments, we use τ = 1 and also learn
τ as a bias. When we learn τ , we instead learn sigm(τ )
since we found this made training more stable. Note that
we can also go one step further and learn τ as a function
of x, though experiments did not show any signiﬁcant gain
over simply learning it as a bias. However, one advantage
of this technique is that the network can quantify its uncer-
tainty on a per-example basis. It is also worth noting that
the Poisson and binomial formulations are slightly under-
parameterised compared to their baselines, but experiments
we ran that addressed this (by matching model capacity)
did not yield signiﬁcantly different results.

It is also important to note that in the case of ordinal
prediction, there are two ways to compute the ﬁnal pre-
diction: simply taking the argmax of p(y|x) (which is
what is simply done in discrete classiﬁcation), or taking
a ‘smoothed’ prediction which is simply the expectation
of the integer labels w.r.t. the probability distribution, i.e.,
E[0, . . . , K − 1]p(y|x). For the latter, we call this the ‘ex-
pectation trick’. A beneﬁt of the latter is that it computes a
prediction that considers the probability mass of all classes.
One beneﬁt of the former however is that we can use it to
easily rank our predictions, which can be important if we
are interested in computing top-k accuracy (rather than top-
1).

We also introduce an ordinal evaluation metric – the
quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) (Cohen, 1968) – which
has seen recent use on ordinal competitions on Kaggle. In-
tuitively, this is a number between [-1,1], where a kappa
κ = 0 denotes the model does no better than random
chance, κ < 0 denotes worst than random chance, and
κ > 0 better than random chance (with κ = 1 being the
best score). The ‘quadratic’ part of the metric imposes a
quadratic penalty on misclassiﬁcations, making it an ap-
propriate metric to use for ordinal problems.3

All experiments utilise an (cid:96)2 norm of 10−4, ADAM opti-
miser (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with initial learning rate 10−3,
and batch size 128. A ‘manual’ learning rate schedule is

3The quadratic penalty is arbitrary but somewhat appropriate
for ordinal problems. One can plug in any cost matrix into the
kappa calculation.

2.3. Experiments

Figure 3 shows the experiments run for the Adience dataset,
for when τ = 1.0 (Figure 3(a)) and when τ is learned (Fig-
ure 3(b)). We can see that for our methods, careful selection
of τ is necessary for the accuracy on the validation set to be
on par with that of the cross-entropy baseline. For τ = 1.0,
accuracy is poor, but even less so when τ is learned. To
some extent, using the smoothed prediction with the ex-
pectation trick alleviates this gap. However, because the
dataset is ordinal, accuracy can be very misleading, so we
should also consider the QWK. For both argmax and ex-
pectation, our methods either outperform or are quite com-
petitive with the baselines, with the exception of the QWK
argmax plot for when τ = 1, where only our binomial for-
mulations were competitive with the cross-entropy base-
line. Overall, considering all plots in Figure 3 it appears
the binomial formulation produces better results than Pois-
son. There also appears to be some beneﬁt gained from
using the EMD loss for Poisson, but not for binomial.

Figure 4 show the experiments run for diabetic retinopa-
thy. We note that unlike Adience, the validation accuracy
does not appear to be so affected across all speciﬁcations
of τ . One potential reason for this is due to Adience having
a larger number of classes compared to DR. As we men-
tioned earlier, the Poisson distribution is somewhat awk-
ward as its variance is equivalent to its mean. Since most of
the probability mass sits at the mean, if the mean of the dis-
tribution is very high (which is the case for datasets with a
large K such as Adience), then the large variance can neg-
atively impact the distribution by taking probability mass
away from the correct class. We can see this effect by com-
paring the distributions in Figure 5 (k = 4) and Figure 6
(k = 8). As with the Adience dataset, the use of the expec-
tation trick brings the accuracy of our methods to be almost
on-par with the baselines. In terms of QWK, only our bino-
mial formulations appear to be competitive, but only in the
argmax case do one of our methods (the binomial formula-
tion) beat the cross-entropy baseline. At least for accuracy,
there appears to be some gain in using the EMD loss for the
binomial formulation. Because DR is a much larger dataset
compared to Adience, it is possible that the deep net is able
to learn reasonable and ‘unimodal-like’ probability distri-
butions without it being enforced in the model architecture.

4We also re-ran experiments using an automatic heuristic to
change the learning rate, and similar experimental results were
obtained.

we compute the top-k accuracy on the test set of the Adi-
ence dataset, shown in Figure 9. We can see that even with
the worst-performing model – the Poisson formulation with
τ = 1 (orange) – produces a better top-3 accuracy than the
cross-entropy baseline (blue).

3. Conclusion

In conclusion, we present a simple technique to enforce
unimodal ordinal probabilistic predictions through the use
of the binomial and Poisson distributions. This is an impor-
tant property to consider in ordinal classiﬁcation because
of the inherent ordering between classes. We evaluate our
technique on two ordinal image datasets and obtain results
competitive or superior to the cross-entropy baseline for
both the quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) metric and top-
k accuracy for both cross-entropy and EMD losses, espe-
cially under the binomial distribution. Lastly, the unimodal
constraint can makes the probability distributions behave
more sensibly in certain settings. However, there may be
ordinal problems where a multimodal distribution may be
more appropriate. We leave an exploration of this issue for
future work. Code will be made available here.5

where k ∈ {1, 2, 3}.

Overall, across both datasets the QWK for our methods are
generally at least competitive with the baselines, especially
if we learn τ to control for the variance. In the empirical re-
sults of da Costa et al. (2008), they found that the binomial
formulation performed better than the Poisson, and when
we consider all of our results in Figure 3 and 4 we come
to the same conclusion. They justify this result by deﬁn-
ing the ‘ﬂexibility’ of a discrete probability distribution and
show that the binomial distribution is more ‘ﬂexible’ than
Poisson. From our results, we believe that these unimodal
methods act as a form of regularization which can be useful
in regimes where one is interested in top-k accuracy. For
example, in the case of top-k accuracy, we want to know
if the ground truth was in the top k predictions, and we
may be interested in such metrics if it is difﬁcult to achieve
good top-1 accuracy. Assume that our probability distribu-
tion p(y|x) has most of its mass on the wrong class, but the
correct class is on either side of it. Under a unimodal con-
straint, it is guaranteed that the two classes on either side of
the majority class will receive the next greatest amount of
probability mass, and this can result in a correct prediction
if we consider top-2 or top-3 accuracy. To illustrate this,
