Abstract

We study the set of all decompositions (cluster-
ings) of a graph through its characterization as
a set of lifted multicuts. This leads us to prac-
tically relevant insights related to the deﬁnition
of classes of decompositions by must-join and
must-cut constraints and related to the compar-
ison of clusterings by metrics. To ﬁnd optimal
decompositions deﬁned by minimum cost lifted
multicuts, we establish some properties of some
facets of lifted multicut polytopes, deﬁne efﬁcient
separation procedures and apply these in a branch-
and-cut algorithm.

1. Introduction

This article is about the set of all decompositions (cluster-
ings) of a graph. A decomposition of a graph G = (V, E)
is a partition Π of the node set V such that, for every subset
U ∈ Π of nodes, the subgraph of G induced by U is con-
nected. An example is depicted in Fig. 1. Decompositions
of a graph arise in practice, as feasible solutions of cluster-
ing problems, and in theory, as a generalization of partitions
of a set, to which they specialize for complete graphs.

We study the set of all decompositions of a graph through
its characterization as a set of multicuts. A multicut of G is
a subset M ⊆ E of edges such that, for every (chordless)
cycle C ⊆ E of G, we have |M ∩ C| (cid:54)= 1. An example is
depicted in Fig. 1. For any graph G, a one-to-one relation
exists between the decompositions and the multicuts of G.
The multicut induced by a decomposition is the set of edges
that straddle distinct components. Multicuts are useful in
the study of decompositions as the characteristic function
x ∈ {0, 1}E of a multicut x−1(1) of G makes explicit, for
every pair {v, w} ∈ E of neighboring nodes, whether v and
w are in distinct components. To make explicit also for non-
neighboring nodes, speciﬁcally, for all {v, w} ∈ E(cid:48) with

Figure 1. A decomposition of a graph is a partition of the node
set into connected subsets. Above, one decomposition is depicted
in green. Any decomposition is characterized by the set of those
edges (depicted as dotted lines) that straddle distinct components.
Such edge sets are precisely the multicuts of the graph.

E ⊆ E(cid:48) ⊆ (cid:0)V
(cid:1), whether v and w are in distinct components,
we deﬁne a lifting of the multicuts of G to multicuts of
G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)). The multicuts of G(cid:48) lifted from G are still in
one-to-one relation with the decompositions of G. Yet, they
are a more expressive model of these decompositions than
the multicuts of G. We apply lifted multicuts in three ways:

Firstly, we study problems related to the deﬁnition of a class
of decompositions by must-cut or must-join constraints (Sec-
tion 4). Such constraints have applications where deﬁning
a decomposition totally is an ambiguous and tedious task,
e.g., in the ﬁeld of image segmentation. The ﬁrst problem
is to decide whether a set of such constraints is consistent,
i.e., whether a decomposition of the given graph exists that
satisﬁes the constraints. We show that this decision prob-
lem is NP-complete in general and can be solved efﬁcienty
for a subclass of constraints. The second problem is to
decide whether a consistent set of must-join and must-cut
constraints is maximally speciﬁc, i.e., whether no such con-
straint can be added without changing the set of decomposi-
tions that satisfy the constraints. We show that this decision
problem is NP-hard in general and can be solved efﬁcienty
for a subclass of constraints. This ﬁnding is relevant for
comparing the classes of decompositions deﬁnable by must-
join and must-cut constraints by certain metrics, which is
the next topic.

As a second application of lifted multicuts, we study the
comparison of decompositions and classes of decomposi-
tions by metrics (Section 5). To obtain a metric on the set of
all decompositions of a given graph, we deﬁne a metric on a
set of lifted multicuts that characterize these decompositions.

Figure 2. For any connected graph G (left), the characteristic func-
tions of all multicuts of G (middle) span, as their convex hull
in RE, the multicut polytope of G (right), a 01-polytope that is
|E|-dimensional (Chopra & Rao, 1993).

Figure 3. For any connected graph G = (V, E) (top left) and any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48) (bottom left), those multicuts of
G(cid:48) that are lifted from G (middle) span, as their convex hull in RE,
the lifted multicut polytope w.r.t. G and G(cid:48) (right), a 01-polytope
that is |E(cid:48)|-dimensional (Thm. 7).

By lifting to different graphs, we obtain different metrics,
two of which are well-known and here generalized. To ex-
tend this metric to the classes of decompositions deﬁnable
by must-join and must-cut constraints, we deﬁne a metric on
partial lifted multicuts that characterize these classes, con-
necting results of Sections 4 and 5. We show that computing
this metric is NP-hard in general and efﬁcient for a subclass
of must-join and must-cut constraints. These ﬁndings have
implications on the applicability of must-join and must-cut
constraints as a form of supervision, more speciﬁcally, on
the practicality of certain error metrics and loss functions.

As a third application of lifted multicuts, we study the opti-
mization of graph decompositions by minimum cost lifted
multicuts. The minimum cost lifted multicut problem is
a generalization of the correlation clustering problem. Its
applications in the ﬁeld of computer vision are mentioned
below. To tackle this problem, we establish some properties
of some facets of lifted multicut polytopes (Fig. 2 and 3),
deﬁne efﬁcient separation procedures and apply these in a
branch-and-cut algorithm.

1.1. Related Work

Initial motivation to study decompositions of a graph by
multicuts came from the ﬁeld of polyhedral optimization.
Multicut polytopes are studied by Gr¨otschel & Wakabayashi
(1989); Deza et al. (1991; 1992); Chopra & Rao (1993;
1995) and Deza & Laurent (1997) who characterize several
classes of their facets.

The binary linear program whose feasible solutions are all
multicuts of a graph is known as the correlation clustering
problem from the work of Bansal et al. (2004) and Demaine
et al. (2006) who establish its APX-hardness and a logarith-
mic approximation. The stability of its solutions is analyzed
by Nowozin & Jegelka (2009). Generalizations to multi-
linear objective functions are studied by Kim et al. (2014)
and Kappes et al. (2016). The problem remains NP-hard
for planar graphs (Voice et al., 2012; Bachrach et al., 2013)
where it admits a PTAS (Klein et al., 2015) and relaxations
that are often tight in practice (Yarkony et al., 2012).

The lifting of multicuts we deﬁne makes path connected-
ness explicit. For a single component, this is studied by
Nowozin & Lampert (2010) who introduce the connected
subgraph polytope and outer relaxations. Applications of
the minimum cost lifted multicut problem and experimen-
tal comparisons to the correlation clustering problem in
the ﬁeld of computer vision are by Keuper et al. (2015)
and Tang et al. (2017) who ﬁnd feasible solutions by local
search (Keuper et al., 2015; Levinkov et al., 2017), and by
Beier et al. (2017) who ﬁnd feasible solutions by consensus
optimization (Beier et al., 2016). The complexity of sev-
eral decision problems related to clustering with must-join
and must-cut constraints is established by Davidson & Ravi
(2007). Well-known metrics on the set of all decompositions
of a graph are the metric of Rand (1971) and the variation
of information (Meil˘a, 2007).

2. Multicuts

Deﬁnition 1 Let G = (V, E) be any graph. A subgraph
G(cid:48) = (V (cid:48), E(cid:48)) of G is called a component of G iff G(cid:48) is
non-empty, node-induced1, and connected2. A partition Π
of V is called a decomposition of G iff, for every U ∈ Π,
the subgraph (U, E ∩ (cid:0)U
(cid:1)) of G induced by U is connected
(and hence a component of G).

2

For any graph G, we denote by DG ⊂ 22V
the set of all
decompositions of G. Useful in the study of decompositions
are the multicuts of a graph:
Deﬁnition 2 For any graph G = (V, E), a subset M ⊆ E
of edges is called a multicut of G iff, for every cycle C ⊆ E
of G, we have |C ∩ M | (cid:54)= 1.

Lemma 1 (Chopra & Rao, 1993) It is sufﬁcient in Def. 2
to consider only the chordless cycles.

For any graph G, we denote by MG ⊆ 2E the set of all
multicuts of G. One reason why multicuts are useful in

1That is: E(cid:48) = E ∩ (cid:0)V (cid:48)
2We do not require a component to be maximal w.r.t. the sub-

(cid:1)

graph relation.

Analysis and Optimization of Graph Decompositions by Lifted Multicuts

the study of decompositions is that, for every graph G, a
one-to-one relation exists between the decompositions and
the multicuts of G. An example is depicted in Fig. 1:
Lemma 2 For any graph G = (V, E), the map φG :
DG → 2E deﬁned by (1) is a bijection from DG to MG.

∀Π ∈ DG ∀{v, w} ∈ E :

{v, w} ∈ φG(Π) ⇔ ∀U ∈ Π(v /∈ U ∨ w /∈ U )

(1)

Another reason why multicuts are useful in the study of
decompositions is that, for any graph G = (V, E) and any
decomposition Π of G, the characteristic function of the
multicut induced by Π is a 01-encoding of Π of ﬁxed length
|E|.
Lemma 3 (Chopra & Rao, 1993) For any graph G =
(V, E) and any x ∈ {0, 1}E, the set x−1(1) of those edges
that are labeled 1 is a multicut of G iff (2) holds. It is
sufﬁcient in (2) to consider only chordless cycles.

∀C ∈ cycles(G) ∀e ∈ C : xe ≤

(cid:88)

xe(cid:48)
e(cid:48)∈C\{e}

For any graph G = (V, E), we denote by XG the set of all
x ∈ {0, 1}E that satisfy (2).

2.1. Complete Graphs
The decompositions of a complete graph KV := (V, (cid:0)V
(cid:1))
are precisely the partitions of the node set V (by Def. 1).
The multicuts of a complete graph KV relate one-to-one to
the equivalence relations on V :
Lemma 4 For any set V and the complete graph KV , the
map ψ : MKV → 2V ×V deﬁned by (3) is a bijection be-
tween MKV and the set of all equivalence relations on V .

2

∀M ∈ MKV ∀v, w ∈ V :

(v, w) ∈ ψ(M ) ⇔ {v, w} /∈ M

(3)

The bijection between the decompositions of a graph and the
multicuts of a graph (Lemma 2) specializes, for complete
graphs, to the well-known bijection between the partitions of
a set and the equivalence relations on the set (by Lemma 4).
In this sense, decompositions and multicuts of graphs gener-
alize partitions of sets and equivalence relations on sets.

3. Lifted Multicuts

For any graph G = (V, E), the characteristic function x ∈
XG of a multicut x−1(1) of G makes explicit, for every
pair {v, w} ∈ E of neighboring nodes, whether v and w
are in distinct components. To make explicit also for non-
neighboring nodes, speciﬁcally, for all {v, w} ∈ E(cid:48) with
E ⊆ E(cid:48) ⊆ (cid:0)V
(cid:1), whether v and w are in distinct components,
we deﬁne a lifting of the multicuts of G to multicuts of
G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)):

2

Deﬁnition 3 For any graphs G = (V, E) and G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48))
with E ⊆ E(cid:48), the composed map λGG(cid:48) := φG(cid:48) ◦ φ−1
G is
called the lifting of multicuts from G to G(cid:48).

For any graphs G = (V, E) and G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48),
we introduce the notation FGG(cid:48) := E(cid:48) \ E, for brevity.
Lemma 5 For any connected graph G = (V, E), any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48) and any x ∈ {0, 1}E(cid:48)
,
the set x−1(1) is a multicut of G(cid:48) lifted from G iff

∀C ∈ cycles(G) ∀e ∈ C : xe ≤

(cid:88)

xe(cid:48)
e(cid:48)∈C\{e}

∀vw ∈ FGG(cid:48) ∀P ∈ vw-paths(G) : xvw ≤

(6)

For any graphs G = (V, E) and G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48)
we denote by XGG(cid:48) the set of all x ∈ {0, 1}E(cid:48)
that satisfy
(4)–(6).

4. Partial Lifted Multicuts

As a ﬁrst application of lifted multicuts, we study the class
of decompositions of a graph deﬁnable by must-join and
must-cut constraints. For this, we consider partial functions.
For any set E, a partial characteristic function of subsets
of E is a function from any subset F ⊆ E to {0, 1}. With
some abuse of notation, we denote the set of all partial
characteristic functions of subsets of E by {0, 1, ∗}E :=
(cid:83)
F ⊆E{0, 1}F . For any x ∈ {0, 1, ∗}E, we denote the
domain of x by dom x := x−1({0, 1}).

For any connected graph G = (V, E) whose decompo-
sitions we care about and any graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with
E ⊆ E(cid:48), we consider a partial function ˜x ∈ {0, 1, ∗}E(cid:48)
. For
any {v, w} ∈ dom ˜x, we constrain the nodes v and w to the
same component if ˜xvw = 0 and to distinct components if
˜xvw = 1.

4.1. Consistency

A natural question to ask is whether a decomposition of the
graph G exists that satisﬁes these constraints. We show that
this decision problem is NP-complete.

Deﬁnition 4 For any connected graph G = (V, E), any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48), and any ˜x ∈ {0, 1, ∗}E(cid:48)
,
the elements of

XGG(cid:48)[˜x] := {x ∈ XGG(cid:48) | ∀e ∈ dom ˜x : xe = ˜xe}

(7)

are called the completions of ˜x in XGG(cid:48). In addition, ˜x is
called consistent and a partial characterization of multicuts

Analysis and Optimization of Graph Decompositions by Lifted Multicuts

of G(cid:48) lifted from G iff

XGG(cid:48)[˜x] (cid:54)= ∅ .

(8)

We denote the set of all partial characterizations of multicuts
of G(cid:48) lifted from G by

˜XGG(cid:48) :=

˜x ∈ {0, 1, ∗}E(cid:48) (cid:12)
(cid:111)
(cid:110)
(cid:12)
(cid:12) XGG(cid:48)[˜x] (cid:54)= ∅

.

(9)

Theorem 1 Deciding consistency is NP-complete.

Lemma 6 Consistency can be decided efﬁciently if E ⊆
dom ˜x or

∀vw ∈ dom ˜x \ E :

˜xvw = 1 ∨ ∃P ∈ vw-path(G) ∀e ∈ P : ˜xe = 0 (10)

4.2. Speciﬁcity

A less obvious question to ask for any partial characteri-
zation ˜x of multicuts of G(cid:48) lifted from G is whether ˜x is
maximally speciﬁc for its completions in XGG(cid:48). In other
words, is there no edge e ∈ E(cid:48) \ dom ˜x such that, for any
completions x, x(cid:48) of ˜x in XGG(cid:48), we have xe = x(cid:48)
e, i.e., an
edge that could be included in dom ˜x without changing the
set of completions of ˜x in XGG(cid:48)? We show that deciding
maximal speciﬁcity is NP-hard.
Deﬁnition 5 Let G = (V, E) a connected graph and G(cid:48) =
(V, E(cid:48)) a graph with E ⊆ E(cid:48). For any ˜x ∈ ˜XGG(cid:48), the edges

E(cid:48)[˜x] := {e ∈ E(cid:48) | ∀x, x(cid:48) ∈ XGG(cid:48)[˜x] : xe = x(cid:48)

e}

(11)

are called decided. The edges E(cid:48) \ E(cid:48)[˜x] are called unde-
cided. Moreover, ˜x is called maximally speciﬁc iff3

E(cid:48)[˜x] ⊆ dom ˜x .

(12)

Lemma 8 For any connected graph G = (V, E) and any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48), speciﬁcity is a partial
order on ˜XGG(cid:48).

Note that two partial characterizations ˜x, ˜x(cid:48) ∈ ˜XGG(cid:48) with
the same completions XGG(cid:48)[˜x] = XGG(cid:48)[˜x(cid:48)] need not be
comparable w.r.t. ≤. For example, consider the graphs G, G(cid:48)
from Fig. 3, consider ˜x : e1 (cid:55)→ 0, e2 (cid:55)→ 0 and ˜x(cid:48) : f (cid:55)→ 0.
Nevertheless, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 9 For any connected graph G = (V, E), any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48), any ˜x ∈ ˜XGG(cid:48) and
(cid:12)
(cid:111)
(cid:12) XGG(cid:48)[˜x(cid:48)] = XGG(cid:48)[˜x]
(cid:12)

(cid:110)
˜x(cid:48) ∈ ˜XGG(cid:48)

˜XGG(cid:48)[˜x] :=

(14)

a maximum of ˜XGG(cid:48)[˜x] w.r.t. ≤ exists and is unique. More-
over, ˜x is maximally speciﬁc in the sense of Def. 5 iff ˜x is
maximal w.r.t. ≤ in ˜XGG(cid:48)[˜x].
Deﬁnition 7 Let G = (V, E) be a connected graph and let
G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) be a graph with E ⊆ E(cid:48). For any ˜x ∈ ˜XGG(cid:48),
we call the unique maximum of ˜XGG(cid:48)[˜x] w.r.t. ≤ the closure
of ˜x w.r.t. G and G(cid:48) and denote it by clGG(cid:48) ˜x.

We denote by ˆXGG(cid:48) the set of all maximally speciﬁc partial
characterizations of multicuts of G(cid:48) lifted from G, i.e.:
(cid:110)
˜x ∈ ˜XGG(cid:48)

ˆXGG(cid:48) :=

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12) ˜x = clGG(cid:48) ˜x

(15)

(cid:111)

.

Theorem 3 For any ˜x, ˜x(cid:48) ∈ ˜XGG(cid:48), we have XGG(cid:48)[˜x] =
XGG(cid:48)[˜x(cid:48)] ⇔ ˜XGG(cid:48)[˜x] = ˜XGG(cid:48)[˜x(cid:48)] ⇔ clGG(cid:48) ˜x = clGG(cid:48) ˜x(cid:48).
Lemma 10 For any connected graph G = (V, E), any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48) and any x ∈ XG, the
closure y := clGG(cid:48) x of x w.r.t. G and G(cid:48) coincides with the
lifting of the multicut x−1(1) of G to the multicut y−1(1) of
G(cid:48), i.e.

(clGG(cid:48) x)−1(1) = λGG(cid:48)(x−1(1)) .

(16)

Theorem 4 Computing closures is NP-hard.
Lemma 11 In the special case that E(cid:48) = E or E ⊆ dom ˜x,
the closure can be computed efﬁciently.

Theorem 2 Deciding maximal speciﬁcity is NP-hard.

Lemma 7 Maximal speciﬁcity can be decided efﬁciently if
E(cid:48) = E or E ⊆ dom ˜x.

5. Metrics

Below, we justify the term maximal speciﬁcity and deﬁne
an operation that maps any partial characterization of lifted
multicuts to one that is maximally speciﬁc.

Deﬁnition 6 For any connected graph G = (V, E) and
any graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48), the relation ≤ on
˜XGG(cid:48) deﬁned by (13) is called the speciﬁcity of partial
characterizations of multicuts of G(cid:48) lifted from G.

∀˜x, ˜x(cid:48) ∈ ˜XGG(cid:48) :

(13)
˜x ≤ ˜x(cid:48) ⇔ dom ˜x ⊆ dom ˜x(cid:48) ∧ ∀e ∈ dom ˜x : ˜xe = ˜x(cid:48)
e

3Note that (12) is equivalent to E(cid:48)[˜x] = dom ˜x, as E(cid:48)[˜x] ⊇

dom ˜x holds by deﬁnition of E(cid:48)[˜x].

5.1. Metrics on Decompositions

As a second application of lifted multicuts, we compare de-
compositions of a given graph by comparing lifted multicuts
that characterize these decompositions. We compare these
lifted multicuts by comparing their characteristic functions
by Hamming metrics: For any E (cid:54)= ∅ and any e ∈ E, we
deﬁne d1

E : {0, 1}E × {0, 1}E → N+

Theorem 5 For any connected graph G = (V, E), any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)), any µ : E(cid:48) → R+, the set E(cid:48)(cid:48) :=
E ∪ E(cid:48) and the graph G(cid:48)(cid:48) := (V, E(cid:48)(cid:48)), the function dµ
E(cid:48) :
XGG(cid:48)(cid:48) × XGG(cid:48)(cid:48) → R+

on XGG(cid:48)(cid:48). Iff G(cid:48) is a supergraph of G, i.e., iff E ⊆ E(cid:48), dµ

By the one-to-one relation between decompositions and
multicuts (Lemma 2), dµ
E(cid:48) induces a pseudo-metric on the
set DG of all decompositions of G. Two special cases are
well-known: For E(cid:48) = E and µ = 1, we have dµ
E(cid:48) = d1
E,
which is the Hamming metric (18) on the multicuts that
characterize the decompositions, also known as the bound-
ary metric on decompositions. For E(cid:48) = (cid:0)V
(cid:1) and µ = 1,
d1
E(cid:48) specializes to the metric of Rand (1971). Between
these extremes, i.e., for E ⊆ E(cid:48) ⊆ (cid:0)V
(cid:1), the metric dµ
E(cid:48)
can be used to analyze more speciﬁcally how two decom-
positions of the same graph differ. We propose an analysis
w.r.t. the distance δvw of nodes v and w in G, i.e., w.r.t. the
length of a shortest vw-path in G. For this, we denote by
δG := max{δvw : vw ∈ (cid:0)V
Deﬁnition 8 For any connected graph G = (V, E) and any
(cid:1) | δvw = n} the set of pairs
n ∈ N, let E[n] := {vw ∈ (cid:0)V
2
of nodes of distance n in G. Moreover, let µn : E[n] → Q+
the constant function that maps any vw ∈ E[n] to 1/|E[n]|.
For any connected graph G = (V, E), we call the sequence

(cid:1)} the diameter of G.

An example of a spectrum of pseudo-metrics is depicted in
Fig. 4. For any two decompositions Π, Π(cid:48) of a connected
graph G and suitable lifted multicuts x, x(cid:48) characterizing
these decompositions, dµn
E[n](x, x(cid:48)) equals the fraction of
pairs of nodes at distance n in G that are either cut by Π and
joined by Π(cid:48), or cut by Π(cid:48) and joined by Π. I.e., the pseudo-
metric dµn
E[n] compares decompositions of G speciﬁcally
w.r.t. the distance n in G. The δ-metric compares decom-
positions w.r.t. all distances, and each distance is weighted
equally. This is in contrast to Rand’s metric which is also a
comparison w.r.t. all distances but each distance is weighted
by the number of pairs of nodes that have this distance.

over, for any ˜x, ˜x(cid:48) ∈ ˜XGG(cid:48):

By the one-to-one relation between decompositions and mul-
ticuts (Lemma 2), every partial characterization of a lifted
multicut ˜x ∈ ˜XGG(cid:48) deﬁnes a class of decompositions of the
graph G, namely those deﬁned by the lifted multicuts char-
acterized by XGG(cid:48)[˜x]. By Theorem 6, ˜dθ

hence a means of comparing the classes of decompositions
deﬁnable by must-join and must-cut constraints. Computing
˜dθ
E(cid:48)(x, x(cid:48)) involves computing the closures of x and x(cid:48) and
is therefore NP-hard (by Theorem 4).

Figure 5. Depicted above in (a) is an instance of the minimum

c = (−1, −1, 3). Here, the cost 3 attributed to the additional edge
in G(cid:48) results in the edges e1 and e2 not being cut in the optimum
(0, 0, 0) which has cost 0. Depicted in (b) is an instance of the
minimum cost multicut problem w.r.t. the graph G(cid:48) and the same
cost function. Here, the cost 3 does not prevent the edges e1 and

If E(cid:48) = E, (25) specializes to the minimum cost multicut
problem w.r.t. G(cid:48) and c that is also known as graph partition
or correlation clustering. If E(cid:48) ⊃ E, the minimum cost
lifted multicut problem w.r.t. G, G(cid:48) and c differs from the
minimum cost multicut problem w.r.t. G(cid:48) and c. It has a
smaller feasible set XGG(cid:48) ⊂ XG(cid:48), as we have shown in
Section 3 and depicted for the smallest example in Fig. 2
and 3. Unlike the minimum cost multicut problem w.r.t. G(cid:48)
and c, the minimum cost lifted multicut problem w.r.t. G, G(cid:48)
and c is such that any feasible solution x ∈ XGG(cid:48) indicates
by xvw = 0 that the nodes v and w are connected in G by a
path of edges labeled 0. See also Fig. 5. This property can be
used to penalize by cvw > 0 precisely those decompositions
of G for which v and w are in distinct components. For
nodes v and w that are not neighbors in G, such costs are
sometimes called non-local attractive.

To solve instances of the APX-hard minimum cost lifted
multicut problem by means of a branch-and-cut algorithm,
we study the geometry of lifted multicut polytopes.

Deﬁnition 10 (Deza & Laurent, 1997) For any graph G =
(V, E), the convex hull ΞG := conv XG of XG in RE is
called the multicut polytope of G.

Deﬁnition 11 For any connected graph G = (V, E) and
any graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48), ΞGG(cid:48)
:=
conv XGG(cid:48) is called the lifted multicut polytope w.r.t. G
and G(cid:48).

Examples are shown in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively. In general,
the lifted multicut polytope ΞGG(cid:48) w.r.t. graphs G and G(cid:48)
(Fig. 3) is a subset of the multicut polytope ΞG(cid:48) of the graph
G(cid:48) (Fig. 2). By Lemma 5, the system of cycle inequalities

(2) for G(cid:48) and cut inequalities (6) for G and G(cid:48) is redundant
as a description of XGG(cid:48) and thus of ΞGG(cid:48). Below, we study
the geometry of ΞGG(cid:48).

6.1. Dimension

Theorem 7 For any connected graph G = (V, E) and any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48), dim ΞGG(cid:48) = |E(cid:48)|.

We prove Theorem 7 by constructing |E(cid:48)| + 1 multicuts of
G(cid:48) lifted from G whose characteristic functions are afﬁne
independent points. The strategy is to construct, for any
e ∈ E(cid:48), an x ∈ XGG(cid:48) with xe = 0 and “as many ones as
possible”. The challenge is that edges cannot be labeled in-
dependently. In particular, for f ∈ FGG(cid:48), xf = 0 can imply,
for certain f (cid:48) ∈ FGG(cid:48) \ {f }, that xf (cid:48) = 0, as illustrated in
Fig. 6. This structure is made explicit below, in Def. 12 and
13 and Lemmata 12 and 13.
Deﬁnition 12 For any connected graph G = (V, E) and
any graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) such that E ⊆ E(cid:48), the sequence
(Fn)n∈N of subsets of FGG(cid:48) deﬁned below is called the
hierarchy of FGG(cid:48) with respect to G:

(a) F0 = ∅
(b) For any n ∈ N and any {v, w} = f ∈ FGG(cid:48):
{v, w} ∈ Fn iff there exists a vw-path in G such that,
for any distinct nodes v(cid:48) and w(cid:48) in the path such that
{v(cid:48), w(cid:48)} (cid:54)= {v, w}, either {v(cid:48), w(cid:48)} (cid:54)∈ FGG(cid:48) or there
exists a natural number j < n such that {v(cid:48), w(cid:48)} ∈ Fj.
Lemma 12 For any connected graph G = (V, E), any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48) and any f ∈ FGG(cid:48), there
exists an n ∈ N such that f ∈ Fn.
Deﬁnition 13 For any connected graph G = (V, E) and
any graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48), the map (cid:96) : FGG(cid:48) →
N such that ∀f ∈ FGG(cid:48)∀n ∈ N : (cid:96)(f ) = n ⇔ f ∈
Fn ∧ f (cid:54)∈ Fn−1 is called the level function of FGG(cid:48).
Lemma 13 For any connected graph G = (V, E), any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48) and for any f ∈ FGG(cid:48),
there exists an x ∈ XGG(cid:48), called f -feasible, such that

(a) xf = 0
(b) xf (cid:48) = 1 for all f (cid:48) ∈ FGG(cid:48) \ {f } with (cid:96)(f (cid:48)) ≥ (cid:96)(f ).

6.2. Facets

We characterize those edges e ∈ E(cid:48) for which the inequality
xe ≤ 1 deﬁnes a facet of the lifted multicut polytope ΞGG(cid:48).
Theorem 8 For any connected graph G = (V, E), any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48) and any e ∈ E(cid:48), the
inequality xe ≤ 1 deﬁnes a facet of ΞGG(cid:48) iff there is no
{v, w} = f ∈ FGG(cid:48) such that e connects a pair of v-w-cut-
vertices4.

4For any graph G = (V, E) and any v, w ∈ V , a v-w-cut-

vertex is a node u ∈ V that lies on every vw-path of G.

Figure 6. If two nodes {v, w} = f ∈ FGG(cid:48) are in the same com-
ponent, as indicated by xf = 0, this can imply xf (cid:48) = 0 for one or
more f (cid:48) ∈ F \ {f }. In (a) xf3 = 0 implies xf1 = 0 and xf2 = 0.
In (b) xf3 = 0 implies xf1 = 0 or xf2 = 0.

Next, we give conditions that contribute to identifying those
edges e ∈ E(cid:48) for which the inequality 0 ≤ xe deﬁnes a
facet of the lifted multicut polytope ΞGG(cid:48).
Theorem 9 For any connected graph G = (V, E), any
graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48) and any e ∈ E(cid:48), the
following assertions hold: In case e ∈ E, the inequality
0 ≤ xe deﬁnes a facet of ΞGG(cid:48) iff there is no triangle in G(cid:48)
containing e. In case uv = e ∈ FGG(cid:48), the inequality 0 ≤
xe deﬁnes a facet of ΞGG(cid:48) only if the following necessary
conditions hold:

(a) There is no triangle in G(cid:48) containing e.
(b) The distance of any pair of u-v-cut-vertices except

{u, v} is at least 3 in G(cid:48).

(c) There is no triangle of nodes s, s(cid:48), t in G(cid:48) such that
{s, s(cid:48)} is a u-v-separating node set and t is a u-v-cut-
vertex.

Next, we characterize those inequalities of (4) and (5) that
are facet-deﬁning for ΞGG(cid:48). Chopra & Rao (1993) have
shown that an inequality of (2) deﬁnes a facet of the multicut
polytope ΞG iff the cycle C is chordless. We establish a
similar characterization of those inequalities of (4) and (5)
that deﬁne a facet of the lifted multicut polytope ΞGG(cid:48). For
clarity, we introduce some notation: For any cycle C of G
and any e ∈ C, let

SGG(cid:48)(e, C) :=

x ∈ XGG(cid:48)

xe =

ΣGG(cid:48)(e, C) := conv SGG(cid:48)(e, C) .

(a) For any cycle C in G and any e ∈ C, the polytope
ΣGG(cid:48)(e, C) is a facet of ΞGG(cid:48) iff C is chordless in G(cid:48).
(b) For any edge vw = f ∈ FGG(cid:48) and any vw-path P
in G, the polytope ΣGG(cid:48)(f, P ) is a facet of ΞGG(cid:48) iff
P ∪ {f } is chordless in G(cid:48).

Inequalities deﬁned by cycles in G(cid:48) that contain more than
one edge from the set FGG(cid:48) do not occur in (4) or (5). They
are valid for ΞGG(cid:48) as they are valid for ΞG(cid:48) ⊇ ΞGG(cid:48). They
deﬁne a (non-trivial) facet of ΞGG(cid:48) only if the cycle is chord-
less (as chordal cycles are not even facet-deﬁning for ΞG(cid:48)).
At the same time, chordlessness is not a sufﬁcient condition
for facet-deﬁningness of non-trivial cycles. For example, in
Fig. 6a, the cycle inequality xf2 ≤ xf3 +xv1v2 is dominated
by the (non-trivial) valid inequality xf2 ≤ xf3 .

Next, we consider the cut inequalities (6). Examples of cuts
that are not facet-deﬁning for ΞGG(cid:48) are shown in Fig. 4
in the appendix. To constrain the class of cuts that are
facet-deﬁning, we introduce additional notation: For any
connected graph G = (V, E), any distinct nodes v, w ∈ V
and any C ∈ vw-cuts(G), we denote by

G(v, C) = (V (v, C), E(v, C))

G(w, C) = (V (w, C), E(w, C))

the largest components of the graph (V, E \ C) that contain
v and w, respectively. By deﬁnition of a vw-cut5, we have

V (v, C) ∩ V (w, C) = ∅

∧ V (v, C) ∪ V (w, C) = V .

We denote by FGG(cid:48)(vw, C) the set of those edges in FGG(cid:48),
except vw, that cross the vw-cut C of G, i.e.

FGG(cid:48)(vw, C) := {f ∈ FGG(cid:48) \ {vw} | f (cid:54)⊆ V (v, C) ∧

f (cid:54)⊆ V (w, C)} .

(34)

We denote by G(cid:48)(vw, C) := (V, FGG(cid:48)(vw, C) ∪ C) the
subgraph of G(cid:48) that comprises all edges from FGG(cid:48)(vw, C)
and C. Finally, we deﬁne

Theorem 10 For any connected graph G = (V, E) and
any graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48), the following asser-
tions hold:

5For any graph G = (V, E) and any distinct nodes v, w ∈ V ,
a vw-cut of G is a minimal (with respect to inclusion) set C ⊆ E
such that v and w are not connected in (V, E \ C).

V ∗ ⊆ V (v, C) ∨ V ∗ ⊆ V (w, C) .

(38)

It is called (vw, C)-connected iff it is properly or improperly
(vw, C)-connected.

For any (vw, C)-connected component (V ∗, E∗) of G, we
denote by FV ∗ := {v(cid:48)w(cid:48) = f (cid:48) ∈ FGG(cid:48)(vw, C) | v(cid:48) ∈ V ∗ ∧
w(cid:48) ∈ V ∗} the set of those edges v(cid:48)w(cid:48) = f (cid:48) ∈ FGG(cid:48)(vw, C)
such that (V ∗, E∗) is also (v(cid:48)w(cid:48), C)-connected.

graph G(cid:48) = (V, E(cid:48)) with E ⊆ E(cid:48), any vw = f ∈ FGG(cid:48)
and any C ∈ vw-cuts(G), ΣGG(cid:48)(vw, C) is a facet of ΞGG(cid:48)
only if the following necessary conditions hold:

C1 For any e ∈ C, there exists a (vw, C)-connected com-

ponent (V ∗, E∗) of G such that e ∈ E∗.

C2 For any ∅ (cid:54)= F ⊆ FGG(cid:48)(vw, C), there exists an edge
e ∈ C and (vw, C)-connected components (V ∗, E∗)
and (V ∗∗, E∗∗) of G such that e ∈ E∗ and e ∈ E∗∗
and |F ∩ FV ∗ | (cid:54)= |F ∩ FV ∗∗ |.

C3 For any f (cid:48) ∈ FGG(cid:48)(vw, C), any ∅ (cid:54)= F ⊆
FGG(cid:48)(vw, C) \ {f (cid:48)} and any k ∈ N,
there ex-

6.3. Algorithms

To study the relevance of geometric properties established
above, we compare two separation procedures, α and β,
for lifted multicut polytopes. We implement these for the
branch-and-cut algorithm in the software Gurobi. Our code

Figure 7. Compared above are the separation procedures α (black)
and β (green) in a branch-and-cut search for solutions of an in-
stance of the minimum cost lifted multicut problem by Keuper
et al. (2015). Upper and lower bounds are depicted as thin and
thick lines, respectively.

procedure α is canonical and serves as a reference. It sep-
arates infeasible points by any of the inequalities (4)–(6).
Violated inequalities of (4) and (5) are found by searching
for shortest chordless paths. Violated inequalities of (5) are
found by searching for minimum vw-cuts. The procedure
β is less canonical: It separates infeasible points by some
cycle inequalities w.r.t. G(cid:48) (cf. Theorem 10) and by cut in-
equalities (6). Violated cycle inequalities of G(cid:48) are found by
ﬁrst seaching for paths and cycles as before but then replac-
ing sub-paths by chords in G(cid:48). Violated cut-inequalities are
found as before but added to the problem only conditionally:
For each violated inequality of (6) that we ﬁnd and the corre-
sponding {v, w} ∈ FGG(cid:48) and C ∈ vw-cuts(G), we search
for a vw-path P in G(cid:48) such that one of the cycle inequali-
ties for the cycle formed by P and {v, w} is violated. If it
exists, only the cycle inequality is added. Otherwise, the
cut-inequality is added. The advantage of β over α can be
seen in Fig. 7 for an instance of the min cost lifted multicut
problem by Keuper et al. (2015) with |V | = 126, |E| = 229
and |E(cid:48)| = 1860.

By studying the set of all decompositions (clusterings) of
a graph through its characterization as a set of lifted multi-
cuts, we have gained three insights: 1. Toward the deﬁnition
of classes of decompositions by must-join and must-cut
constraints, we have seen that consistency and maximal
speciﬁcity are NP-hard to decide. 2. Toward the comparison
of decompositions by metrics, we have deﬁned a generaliza-
tion of Rand’s metric and the boundary metric that enables
more detailed analyses of how two decompositions of the
same graph differ. This metric extends to classes of decom-
positions deﬁnable by must-join and must-cut constraints for
which it is NP-hard to compute. 3. Toward the optimization
of graph decompositions by minimum cost lifted multicuts,
we have established some properties of some facets of lifted
multicut polytopes. These properties have led us to efﬁcient
separation procedures and a branch-and-cut algorithm for
the minimum cost lifted multicut problem.
