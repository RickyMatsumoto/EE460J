An Analytical Formula of Population Gradient for two-layered ReLU network

Abstract

In this paper, we explore theoretical prop-
training a two-layered ReLU net-
erties of
K
j=1 σ(w⊺
work g(x; w) =
x) with cen-
tered d-dimensional spherical Gaussian input x
P
(σ=ReLU). We train our network with gradient
descent on w to mimic the output of a teacher
network with the same architecture and ﬁxed pa-
rameters w∗. We show that its population gra-
dient has an analytical formula, leading to inter-
esting theoretical analysis of critical points and
convergence behaviors. First, we prove that criti-
cal points outside the hyperplane spanned by the
teacher parameters (“out-of-plane“) are not iso-
lated and form manifolds, and characterize in-
plane critical-point-free regions for two ReLU
case. On the other hand, convergence to w∗ for
one ReLU node is guaranteed with at least (1
−
ǫ)/2 probability, if weights are initialized ran-
domly with standard deviation upper-bounded by
O(ǫ/√d), consistent with empirical practice. For
network with many ReLU nodes, we prove that
an inﬁnitesimal perturbation of weight initializa-
tion results in convergence towards w∗ (or its
permutation), a phenomenon known as sponta-
neous symmetric-breaking (SSB) in physics. We
assume no independence of ReLU activations.
Simulation veriﬁes our ﬁndings.

1. Introduction

Despite empirical success of deep learning (e.g., Computer
Vision (He et al., 2016; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015;
Szegedy et al., 2015; Krizhevsky et al., 2012), Natural
Language Processing (Sutskever et al., 2014) and Speech
Recognition (Hinton et al., 2012)), it remains elusive how

the complicated non-convex optimization during training.
In this paper, we focus on a two-layered ReLU network:

x),

(1)

Xj=1
Here σ(x) = max(x, 0) is the ReLU nonlinearity. We con-
sider the setting that a student network is optimized to min-
imize the l2 distance between its prediction and the super-
vision provided by a teacher network of the same archi-
tecture with ﬁxed parameters w∗. Note that although the
network prediction (Eqn. 1) is convex, when coupled with
loss (e.g., l2 loss Eqn. 2), the optimization becomes highly
non-convex and has exponential number of critical points.

To analyze it, we introduce a simple analytic formula for
population gradient in the case of l2 loss, when inputs x are
sampled from zero-mean spherical Gaussian. Using this
formula, critical point and convergence analysis follow.

For critical points, we show that critical points outside the
principal hyperplane (the subspace spanned by w∗) form
manifolds. We also characterize the region in the principal
hyperplane that has no critical points, in two ReLU case.

We also analyze the convergence behavior under the pop-
ulation gradient. Using Lyapunov method (LaSalle & Lef-
schetz, 1961), for single ReLU case we prove that gra-
dient descent converges to w∗ with at least (1
ǫ)/2
probability, if initialized randomly with standard deviation
upper-bounded by O(ǫ/√d), verifying common initializa-
tion techniques (Bottou, 1988; Glorot & Bengio, 2010; He
et al., 2015; LeCun et al., 2012). For multiple ReLU case,
K
j=1 form an orthonor-
when the teacher parameters
mal basis, we prove that (1) a symmetric weight initial-
ization gets stuck at a saddle point and (2) a particular
inﬁnitesimal perturbation of (1) leads to convergence to-
wards w∗ or its permutation. The behavior that the popula-
tion gradient ﬁeld is invariant under certain symmetry but
the solution breaks it, is known as spontaneous symmetry
breaking in physics. Although such behaviors are known
practically, to our knowledge, we ﬁrst formally character-
ize them in 2-layered ReLU network. Codes are available 1.

lyze its critical points and convergence behaviors.
(Saxe et al., 2013) analyzes its dynamics of gradient de-
scent and (Kawaguchi, 2016) shows every local minimum
is global. On the other hand, very few theoretical works
have been done for nonlinear networks. (Mei et al., 2016)
shows the global convergence for a single nonlinear node
whose derivatives of activation σ′, σ′′, σ′′′ are bounded and
σ′ > 0. Similar to our approach, (Saad & Solla, 1996) also
uses the student-teacher setting and analyzes the student
dynamics when the teacher’s parameters w∗ are orthonor-
mal. However, their activation is Gaussian error function
erf(x), and only the local behaviors of the two critical
points (the initial saddle point near the origin and w∗) are
analyzed. Recent paper (Zhang et al., 2017) analyzes a
similar teacher-student setting on 2-layered network when
the involved function is harmonic, but it is unclear how the
conclusion is generalized to ReLU case. To our knowl-
edge, our close-form formula for 2-layered ReLU network
is novel, as well as the critical point and convergence
analysis. Concurrent work (Brutzkus & Globerson, 2017)
proposes the same formula with a different approach,
and provides similar convergence analysis for one node.
For multiple nodes, they assume non-overlapping shared
weights, a special case of our assumption (Sec. 6.2) that
weights are cyclically symmetric and orthonormal.

Many previous works analyze nonlinear network based
on the assumption of independent activations: the activa-
tions of ReLU (or other nonlinear) nodes are independent
of the input and/or mutually independent. For example,
(Choromanska et al., 2015a;b) relates the nonlinear ReLU
network with spin-glass models when several assumptions
hold, including the assumption of independent activations
(A1p and A5u). (Kawaguchi, 2016) proves that every local
minimum in nonlinear network is global based on similar
assumptions. (Soudry & Carmon, 2016) shows the global

optimality of the local minimum in a two-layered ReLU
network, when independent multiplicative Bernoulli noise
is applied to the activations.
In practice, activations that
share the input are highly dependent. Ignoring such depen-
dency misses important behaviors, and may lead to mis-
leading conclusions. In this paper, no assumption of inde-
pendent activations is made. Instead, we assume input to
follow spherical Gaussian distribution, which gives more
realistic and interdependent activations during training.

For sigmoid activation, (Fukumizu & Amari, 2000) gives
complicated conditions for a local minimum to be
global when adding a new node to a 2-layered network.
(Janzamin et al., 2015) gives guarantees for parameter re-
covery of a 2-layered network learnt with tensor decompo-
sition. In comparison, we analyze ReLU networks trained
with gradient descent, which is more popular in practice.

3. Problem Deﬁnition

Denote N as the number of samples and d as the input di-
mension. The N -by-d matrix X is the input data and w∗
is the ﬁxed parameter of the teacher network. Given the
current estimation w, we have the following l2 loss:

4. The Analytical Formula

≡

Properties of ReLU. ReLU nonlinearity has useful prop-
erties. We deﬁne the gating function D(w)
diag(Xw >
0) as an N -by-N binary diagonal matrix. Its l-th diagonal
element is a binary variable showing whether the neuron
is activated for sample l. Using this notation, σ(Xw) =
D(w)Xw which means D(w) selects the output of a lin-
ear neuron, based on their activations. Note that D(w) only
depends on the direction of w but not its magnitude.
D(w) is also “transparent” with respect to derivatives. For
example, at differentiable regions, Jacobianw[σ(Xw)] =
σ′(Xw)X = D(w)X. This gives a very concise rule for
gradient descent update in ReLU networks.

ulation gradient E [

proportional to the amount of activated data whose ReLU

of the data contribute to the term; when θ = π, the gating
function is completely switched off. The gate is controlled
by the angle between w and the control signal e. The sec-
ond asymmetric term is aligned with e, and is proportional
to the asymmetry of the activated data samples (Fig. 2).

5. Critical Point Analysis

By solving Eqn. 8 (the normal equation, E
= 0),
we could identify all critical points of g(x). However, it is
highly nonlinear and cannot be solved easily. In this paper,
we provide conditions for critical points using the structure
of Eqn. 8. The case study for K = 2 gives examples for
saddle points and regions without critical points.

The intuition is to construct a rotational matrix that is not
identity matrix but keeps Π∗ invariant. Such matrices form
a Lie group
that transforms critical points to critical
points. Then for any out-of-plane critical point, there is
one matrix in
that changes at least one of its weights,
yielding a non-isolated different critical point.

whether it is indeed a critical point. This gives necessary
conditions for critical points that only depend on angles.

very small radius (but not at w = 0), so that Ω looks like
a hyperplane near the origin, and thus almost half samples

The idea is to lower-bound the probability of the shaded

initialization techniques (Glorot & Bengio, 2010; He et al.,
2015; LeCun et al., 2012; Bottou, 1988) that uses random
variables with O(1/√d) standard deviation.

6.2. Multiple ReLU case

no decisive conclusion. Here we focus on the symmet-
ric property of Eqn. 8 and discuss a special case, that

Eqn. 18 has interesting properties, known as Spontaneous
Symmetric-Breaking (SSB) in physics (Brading & Castel-
lani, 2003), in which the equations of motion respect a cer-
tain symmetry but its solution breaks it (Fig. 6). In our lan-
guage, despite that the population gradient ﬁeld E [
wJ]
and the objective E [J] are invariant to the group transfor-
wJ] remain
mation
the same, its solution is not (Pjw

since

to different permutations of w∗ due to inﬁnitesimal pertur-
bations of initialization.

to a different ﬁxed point Pjw∗ for some j. Unlike single
ReLU case, the initialization in Thm. 7 is w∗-dependent,
and serves as an example for the branching behavior.

Thm. 7 also suggests that for convergence, x0 and y0 can
be arbitrarily small, regardless of the magnitude of w∗,
showing a global convergence behavior.
In comparison,
(Saad & Solla, 1996) uses Gaussian error function (σ =
erf) as the activation, and only analyzes local behaviors
near the two ﬁxed points (origin and w∗).

In practice, even with noisy initialization, Eqn. 18 and the
original dynamics (Eqn. 8) still converge to w∗ (and its
transformations). We leave it as a conjecture, whose proof
may lead to an initialization technique for 2-layered ReLU
that is w∗-independent.

We verify E [F (e, w)] = E [X ⊺D(e)D(w)Xw] (Eqn. 5)
with simulation. We randomly pick e and w so that their
angle ∠(e, w) is uniformly distributed in [0, π]. The an-
alytical formula E [F (e, w)] is compared with F (e, w),
which is computed via sampling on the input X that
follows spherical Gaussian distribution. We use relative

Fig. 7(a) shows that the formula is more accurate with more

X, e.g., U [

still works for large d. Note that the error is computed up to
a global scale, due to different normalization constants in
probability distributions. Whether Eqn. 5 applies for more
general distributions remains open.

7.2. Empirical Results in critical point analysis K = 2

Conjecture 1 can be reduced to enumerate a complicated
but 2D function via exhaustive sampling. In comparison, a
full optimization of 2-ReLU network constrained on prin-
cipal hyperplane Π∗ involves 6 parameters (8 parameters
minus 2 degrees of symmetry) and is more difﬁcult to han-
dle. Fig. 10 shows that empirically L12 has no extra zero-
crossing other than e∗ = e1 or e2. As shown in Fig. 10(c),

Fig. 8(a) and (b) shows the 2D vector ﬁeld in Thm 7.
Fig. 8(c) shows the 2D trajectory towards convergence to
the teacher’s parameters w∗.
Interestingly, even when
we initialize the weights as [10−3, 0]⊺, whose direction is
aligned with w∗ at [1, 0]⊺, the gradient descent still takes
detours to reach the destination. This is because at the be-
ginning of optimization, all ReLU nodes explain the train-
ing error in the same way (both x and y increases); when
the “obvious” component is explained, the error pushes
some nodes to explain other components. Hence, special-
ization follows (x increases but y decreases).

9. Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we study the gradient descent dynamics of a
2-layered bias-free ReLU network. The network is trained
using gradient descent to reproduce the output of a teacher
network with ﬁxed parameters w∗ in the sense of l2 norm.
We propose a novel analytic formula for population gradi-
ent when the input follows zero-mean spherical Gaussian
distribution. This formula leads to interesting critical point
and convergence analysis. Speciﬁcally, we show that crit-
ical points out of the hyperplane spanned by w∗ are not
isolated and form manifolds. For two ReLU case, we char-
acterize regions that contain no critical points. For con-
vergence analysis, we show guaranteed convergence for a
single ReLU case with random initialization whose stan-
dard deviation is on the order of O(1/√d). For multiple
ReLU case, we show that an inﬁnitesimal change of weight
initialization leads to convergence to different optima.

Our work opens many future directions. First, Thm. 2 char-
acterizes the non-isolating nature of critical points in the
case of isotropic input distribution, which explains why of-
ten practical solutions of NN are degenerated. What if the
input distribution has different symmetries? Will such sym-
metries determine the geometry of critical points? Second,
empirically we see convergence cases that are not covered
by the theorems, suggesting the conditions imposed by the
theorems can be weaker. Finally, how to apply similar anal-
ysis to broader distributions and how to generalize the anal-
ysis to multiple layers are also open problems.
