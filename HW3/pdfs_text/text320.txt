schema-networks for visualizations of Schema
Networks playing different variations of Breakout after
training only on basic Breakout.

Figure 1 shows typical gameplay for one variation.

Algorithm 1 LP-based greedy schema learning

Input: Input vectors {xn} for which fW (xn) = 0 (the
current schema network predicts 0), and the corre-
sponding output scalars yn

1: Find a cluster of input samples that can be solved
with a single (relaxed) schema while keeping perfect
precision (no false alarms). Select an input sample and
put it in the set “solved”, then solve the LP

min
w∈[0,1]D

(cid:88)

n:yn=1

(1 − xn)w

s.t. (1 − xn)w > 1 ∀n:yn=0
(1 − xn)w = 0 ∀n∈solved

2: Simplify the resulting schema. Put all the input sam-
ples for which (1 − xn)w = 0 in the set “solved”. Sim-
plify the just found schema w by making it as sparse as
possible while keeping the same precision and recall:

min
w∈[0,1]D

wT(cid:126)1

s.t. (1 − xn)w > 1 ∀n:yn=0
(1 − xn)w = 0 ∀n∈solved

3: Binarize the schema. In practice, the found w is bi-
nary most of the time. If it is not, repeat the previous
minimization using binary programming, but optimize
only over the elements of w that were found to be non-
zero. Keep the rest clamped to zero.
Output: New schema w to add to the network

(b) Schema Networks

Figure 1. Screen average during the course of gameplay in the
Midwall variation when using A3C and Schema Networks. SNs
are able to purposefully avoid the middle wall most of the time,
whereas A3C struggles to score any points.

vided here.
