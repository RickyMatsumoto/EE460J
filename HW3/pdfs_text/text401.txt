Global optimization of Lipschitz functions

C´edric Malherbe 1 Nicolas Vayatis 1

Abstract
The goal of the paper is to design sequential
strategies which lead to efﬁcient optimization of
an unknown function under the only assumption
that it has a ﬁnite Lipschitz constant. We ﬁrst
identify sufﬁcient conditions for the consistency
of generic sequential algorithms and formulate
the expected minimax rate for their performance.
We introduce and analyze a ﬁrst algorithm called
LIPO which assumes the Lipschitz constant to
be known. Consistency, minimax rates for LIPO
are proved, as well as fast rates under an addi-
tional H¨older like condition. An adaptive version
of LIPO is also introduced for the more realistic
setup where the Lipschitz constant is unknown
and has to be estimated along with the optimiza-
tion. Similar theoretical guarantees are shown
to hold for the adaptive algorithm and a numer-
ical assessment is provided at the end of the pa-
per to illustrate the potential of this strategy with
respect to state-of-the-art methods over typical
benchmark problems for global optimization.

1. Introduction

In many applications such as complex system design or
hyperparameter calibration for learning systems, the goal
is to optimize the output value of an unknown function
with as few evaluations as possible. Indeed, in such con-
texts, evaluating the performance of a single set of pa-
rameters often requires numerical simulations or cross-
validations with signiﬁcant computational cost and the op-
erational constraints impose a sequential exploration of the
solution space with small samples. Moreover, it can ge-
nerally not be assumed that the function has good prop-
erties such as linearity or convexity. This generic prob-
lem of sequentially optimizing the output of an unknown
and potentially nonconvex function is often referred to as

global optimization (Pint´er, 1991), black-box optimization
(Jones et al., 1998) or derivative-free optimization (Rios &
Sahinidis, 2013). There is a large number of algorithms
based on various heuristics which have been introduced
in order to solve this problem such as genetic algorithms,
model-based methods or Bayesian optimization. We focus
here on the smoothness-based approach to global optimiza-
tion. This approach is based on the simple observation that,
in many applications, the system presents some regularity
with respects to the input. In particular, the use of the Lips-
chitz constant, ﬁrst proposed in the seminal works of (Shu-
bert, 1972; Piyavskii, 1972), initiated an active line of re-
search and played a major role in the development of many
efﬁcient global optimization algorithms such as DIRECT
(Jones et al., 1993), MCS (Huyer & Neumaier, 1999) or
SOO (Preux et al., 2014). Convergence properties of global
optimization methods have been developed in the works of
(Valko et al., 2013; Munos, 2014) under local smoothness
assumptions, but, up to our knowledge, such properties
have not been considered in the case where only the global
smoothness of the function can be speciﬁed. An interest-
ing question is how much global assumptions on regularity
which cover in some sense local assumptions may improve
the convergence of the latter. In this work, we address the
following questions: (i) ﬁnd the limitations and the best
performance that can be achieved by any algorithm over the
class of Lipschitz functions and (ii) design efﬁcient and op-
timal algorithms for this class of problems. Our contribu-
tion with regards to the above mentioned works is twofold.
First, we introduce two novel algorithms for global opti-
mization which exploit the global smoothness of the func-
tion and display good performance in typical benchmarks
for optimization. Second, we show that these algorithms
can achieve faster rates of convergence on globally smooth
problems than the previously known methods which only
exploit the local smoothness of the function. The rest of the
paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce
the framework and give generic results about the conver-
gence of sequential algorithms. In Section 3, we introduce
and analyze the LIPO algorithm which requires the knowl-
edge of the Lipschitz constant. In Section 4, the algorithm
is extended to the case where the Lipschitz constant is un-
known and the adaptive algorithm is compared to existing
methods in Section 5. All proofs can be found in the Sup-
plementary Material provided as a separate document.

put domain

ﬁnding some point

with a minimal amount of function evaluations. The stan-
dard setup involves a sequential procedure which starts
by evaluating the function f (X1) at an initial point X1
1 an evaluation
and then selects at each step t
≥
point Xt+1
depending on the previous evaluations
(X1, f (X1)), . . . , (Xt, f (Xt)) and receives the evaluation
of the unknown function f (Xt+1) at this point. After n
iterations, we consider that the algorithm returns an evalu-
ation point Xˆın with ˆın
arg mini=1...n f (Xi) which has
recorded the highest evaluation. The performance of the
algorithm over the function f is then measured after n iter-
ations through the difference between the value of the true
maximum and the highest evaluation observed so far:

∈

f (Xi).

The analysis provided in the paper considers that the num-
ber n of evaluation points is not ﬁxed and it is assumed that
function evaluations are noiseless. Moreover, the assump-
tion made on the unknown function f throughout the paper
is that it has a ﬁnite Lipschitz constant k, i.e.
f (x(cid:48))

∃
Before starting the analysis, we point out that similar set-
tings have also been studied in (Munos, 2014; Malherbe
et al., 2016) and that (Valko et al., 2013; Grill et al., 2015)
considered the noisy scenario.

In order to design efﬁcient procedures, we ﬁrst investigate
the best performance that can be achieved by any algorithm
over the class of Lipschitz functions.

Sequential algorithms and optimization consistency. We
describe the sequential procedures that are considered here
and the corresponding concept of consistency in the sense
of global optimization.

Asymptotic performance. We now investigate the mini-
mal conditions for a sequential algorithm to achieve asymp-
totic convergence. Of course, it is expected that a global
optimization algorithm should be consistent at least for the
class of Lipschitz functions and the following result reveals
a necessary and sufﬁcient condition (NSC) in this case.

Proposition 3 (CONSISTENCY NSC) A global optimiza-
tion algorithm A is consistent over the set of Lipschitz func-
tions if and only if

A crucial consequence of the latter proposition is that the
design of any consistent method ends up to covering the
whole input space regardless of the function values. The
example below introduces the most popular space-ﬁlling
method which will play a central role in our analysis.

Global optimization of Lipschitz functions

Example 4 (PURE RANDOM SEARCH) The Pure Random
Search (PRS) consists in sequentially evaluating the func-
tion over a sequence of points X1, X2, X3, . . . uniformly
and independently distributed over the input space

this method, a simple union bound indicates that for all

In addition to this result, we point out that the covering rate
of any method can easily be shown to be at best of order
Ω(n−1/d) and thus subject to to the curse of dimension-
ality by means of covering arguments. Keeping in mind
the equivalence of Proposition 3, we may now turn to the
nonasymptotic analysis.

Finite-time performance. We investigate here the best
performance that can be achieved by any algorithm with
a ﬁnite number of function evaluations. We start by cast-
ing a negative result stating that any algorithm can suffer, at
any time, an arbitrarily large loss over the class of Lipschitz
functions.

Proposition 5 Consider any global optimization algo-
rithm A. Then, for any constant C > 0 arbitrarily large,
any n
there exists a function

This result might however not be very surprising since the
class of Lipschitz functions includes functions with ﬁnite,
but arbitrarily large variations. When considering the sub-
class of functions with ﬁxed Lipschitz constant, it becomes
possible to derive ﬁnite-time bounds on the minimax rate
of convergence.

Proposition 6 (MINIMAX RATE) adapted from (Bull,

We point out that this minimax rate of convergence of or-
der Θ(n−1/d) can still be achieved by any method with
an optimal covering rate of order O(n−1/d). Observe in-
deed that since E [maxx∈X f (x)

then an optimal covering rate necessarily implies minimax
efﬁciency. However, as it can be seen by examining the
proof of Proposition 6 provided in the Supplementary Ma-
terial, the functions constructed to prove the limiting bound
of Ω(n−1/d) are spikes which are almost constant every-
where and do not present a large interest from a practical
perspective. In particular, we will see in the sequel that one
can design:

I) An algorithm with ﬁxed constant k

0 which achieves
minimax efﬁciency and also presents exponentially
decreasing rates over a large subset of functions, as
opposed to space-ﬁlling methods (LIPO, Section 3).

II) A consistent algorithm which does not require the
knowledge of the Lipschitz constant and presents
comparable performance as when the constant k is as-
sumed to be known (AdaLIPO, Section 4).

More formally, the mechanism behind this rule can be ex-
plained using the active subset of consistent functions pre-
viously considered in active learning (see, e.g., (Dasgupta,
2011) and (Hanneke, 2011)).

Deﬁnition 7 (CONSISTENT FUNCTIONS) The active sub-
set of k-Lipschitz functions consistent with the unknown
function f over a sample (X1, f (X1)), . . . , (Xt, f (Xt)) of
t

1 evaluations is deﬁned as follows:

Deﬁnition 8 (POTENTIAL MAXIMIZERS) Using the same

Hence, we deduce from this lemma that the algorithm only
evaluates the function over points that still have a chance to
be maximizers of the unknown function.

Remark 10 (EXTENSION TO OTHER SMOOTHNESS AS-
SUMPTIONS) It is important to note the proposed opti-
mization scheme could easily be extended to a large num-
ber of sets of globally and locally smooth functions by
slightly adapting the decision rule. For instance, when

simply consists in testing whether maxi=1...t f (Xi)

pose of this work is to design fast algorithms for Lipschitz
functions, we will only derive convergence results for the
version of the algorithm stated above.

We start with the consistency property of the algorithm.

one thus should expect the algorithm exploiting the global

least similarly to the one using the local smoothness (DOO)

the constants are not necessarily optimal, it is also interest-
ing to note that the term (k√d/cκ)d appearing in both the
exponential rates of LIPO and DOO tends to suggest that
if f is also known to be locally smooth for some k(cid:96)

The AdaLIPO algorithm (Algorithm 2) is an extension of
LIPO which involves an estimate of the Lipschitz constant
and takes as input a parameter p
(0, 1) and a nondecreas-
ing sequence of Lipschitz constant ki∈Z deﬁning a mesh-
grid of R+ (i.e. such that
x > 0,
≤
ki+1). The algorithm is initialized with a Lipschitz constant
ˆk1 set to 0 and alternates randomly between two distinct
phases: exploration and exploitation. Indeed, at step t < n,
a Bernoulli random variable Bt+1 of parameter p driving
this trade-off is sampled. If Bt+1 = 1, then the algorithm
explores the space by evaluating the function over a point
. Otherwise, if Bt+1 = 0, the
uniformly sampled over
algorithm exploits the previous evaluations by making an
iteration of the LIPO algorithm with the smallest Lipschitz
constant of the sequence ˆkt which is associated with a sub-
set of Lipschitz functions that probably contains f (step ab-
breviated in the algorithm by Xt+1
ˆkt,t)). Once an
evaluation has been made, the Lipschitz constant estimate
ˆkt is updated.

4.2. Convergence analysis

Lipschitz constant estimate. Before starting the analysis
of AdaLIPO, we ﬁrst provide a control on the Lipschitz
constant estimate based on a sample of random evaluations
that will be useful to analyse its performance. In partic-
ular, the next result illustrates the purpose of using a dis-
cretization of Lipschitz constant instead of a raw estimate
of the maximum slope by showing that, given this estimate,
a small subset of functions containing the unknown func-
tion can be recovered in a ﬁnite-time.

Remark 20 (DENSITY OF THE SEQUENCE) As a direct
consequence of the previous remark, we point out that
the density of the sequence ki∈Z, captured here by α =
ki)/ki has opposite impacts on the max-
supi∈Z(ki+1
imal deviation of the estimate and its convergence rate.
Indeed, since α is involved in both the following upper

sequence with a small α reduces the bias but also the con-
vergence rate through a small coefﬁcient Γ(f, ki(cid:63)−1).

This bound shows the precise impact of the parameters p
and ki∈Z on the convergence of the algorithm. In particular,
it illustrates the complexity of the exploration/exploitation
trade-off through a constant term and a convergence rate
which are inversely correlated to the exploration parameter
and the density of the sequence of Lipschitz constants.

The DIRECT algorithm (Jones et al., 1993) is a Lipschitz
algorithm with unknown constant which uses a determin-
istic splitting technique of the search space to evaluate the
function on subdivisions of the space that have recorded
the highest evaluation among all subdivisions of similar
size. Moreover, (Munos, 2014) generalized DIRECT in
a broader setting by extending DOO to any unknown and
arbitrary local semi-metric. With regards to these works,
we proposed an alternative stochastic strategy which di-
rectly relies on the estimation of the Lipschitz constant and
thus only presents guarantees for globally smooth func-
tions. However, as far as we know, only the consistency
property of DIRECT was shown in (Finkel & Kelley, 2004)
and (Munos, 2014) derived convergence rates of the same
order as for DOO, except that the best rate they derive is
n) to be compared with the fast rate of
of order O(e−c
P(e−cn). The conclusion of
AdaLIPO which is of order O∗
the comparison thus remains the same as in Section 3: ex-
ploiting the global smoothness instead of just the local one
allows to derive faster algorithms in the some cases where
the unknown function is indeed globally smooth.

5. Experiments

We compare here the empirical performance of AdaLIPO
with ﬁve state-of-the-art global optimization methods.

Algorithms. BAYESOPT∗ (Martinez-Cantin, 2014) is a
Bayesian optimization algorithm which uses a distribution
over functions to build a surrogate model of the unknown
function. The parameters of the distribution are estimated
during the optimization process. CMA-ES‡(Hansen, 2006)
is an evolutionary algorithm which samples the new evalu-
ation points according to a multivariate normal distribution
with mean vector and covariance matrix computed from the
previous evaluations. CRS†(Kaelo & Ali, 2006) is a vari-
ant of PRS including local mutations which starts with a
random population and evolves these points by an heuris-
tic rule. MLSL†(Kan & Timmer, 1987) is a multistart al-
gorithm performing a series of local optimizations start-
ing from points randomly chosen by a clustering heuris-
tic that helps to avoid repeated searches of the same lo-
cal optima. DIRECT†(Jones et al., 1993) and PRS were
previously introduced. For a fair comparison, the tuning
parameters were all set to default and AdaLIPO was con-
stantly used with a parameter p set to 0.1 and a sequence
ki = (1 + 0.01/d)i ﬁxed by an arbitrary rule of thumb. 1
Data sets. Following the steps of (Malherbe & Vayatis,
2016), we ﬁrst studied the task of estimating the regulariza-
tion parameter λ and the bandwidth σ of a gaussian kernel

practice, the average was estimated from a Monte Carlo
sampling of 106 evaluations and the maximum by taking
the best value observed over all the sets of experiments.
Based on these stopping times, we computed the average

Results. Results are collected in Table 2. Due to space
constraints, we only make few comments. First, we point
out that the proposed method displays very competitive re-
sults over most of the problems of the benchmark (except
on the non-smooth DebN.1 where most methods fail). In
particular, AdaLIPO obtains several times the best perfor-
mance for the target 90% and 95% (see, e.g., BreastCancer,
HolderTable, Sphere) and experiments Linear Slope and
Sphere also suggest that, in the case of smooth functions, it
can be robust against the dimensionality of the input space.
However, in some cases, the algorithm can be witnessed
to reach the 95% target with very few evaluations while
getting more slowly to the 99% target (see, e.g., Concrete,
Housing). This problem is due to the instability of the Lip-
schitz constant estimate around the maxima but could cer-
tainly be solved with the addition of a noise parameter that
would allow the algorithm be more robust against local per-
turbations. Additionally, investigating better values for p
and ki as well as alternative covering methods such as LHS
(Stein, 1987) could also be promising approaches to im-
prove its performance. However, an empirical analysis of
the algorithm with these extensions is beyond the scope of
the paper and will be carried out in a future work.

6. Conclusion

We introduced two novel strategies for global optimization:
LIPO which requires the knowledge of the Lipschitz con-
stant and its adaptive version AdaLIPO which estimates
the constant during the optimization process. A theoreti-
cal analysis is provided and empirical results based on syn-
thetic and real problems have been obtained demonstrating
the performance of the adaptive algorithm with regards to
existing state-of-the-art global optimization methods.
