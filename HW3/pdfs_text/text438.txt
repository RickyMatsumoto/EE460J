A. Subspace Matching Interpretation of Covariance Matching GAN

Let ∆ω = Σω(P)
Σω(Q). ∆ω is a symmetric matrix but not PSD, which has the property that its eigenvalues λj are
and its left and right singular vectors coincides with its eigenvectors
related to its singular values as given by: σj =
and satisfy the following equality uj = sign(λj)vj. One can ask here if we can avoid having both U, V in the deﬁnition
of IPMΣ since at the optimum uj =

vj. One could consider δEω(Pr, Pθ) deﬁned as follows:

λj|
|

−

and then solve for mingθ δEω(Pr, Pθ). Note that:

δEω is not symmetric furthermore the sum of those eigenvalues is not guaranteed to be positive and hence δEω is not
guaranteed to be non negative, and hence does not deﬁne an IPM. Noting that σi(∆ω) =

,we have that:

λi(∆ω)

Hence δE is not an IPM but can be optimized as a lower bound of the IPMΣ. This would have an energy interpretation
as in the energy based GAN introduced recently (Zhao et al., 2017): the discriminator deﬁnes a subspace that has higher
energy on real data than fake data, and the generator maximizes his energy in this subspace.

B. Mean and Covariance Matching Loss Combinations

We report below samples for McGan, with different IPMµ,q and IPMΣ combinations. All results are reported for the same
architecture choice for generator and discriminator, which produced qualitatively good samples with IPMΣ (Same one
reported in Section 6 in the main paper). Note that in Figure 7 with the same hyper-parameters and architecture choice,
WGAN failed to produce good sample. In other conﬁgurations training converged.
