Abstract

We study the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem
where the agent receives a vectorial feedback that
encodes many possibly competing objectives to
be optimized. The goal of the agent is to ﬁnd
a policy, which can optimize these objectives
simultaneously in a fair way. This multi-objective
online optimization problem is formalized by us-
ing the Generalized Gini Index (GGI) aggregation
function. We propose an online gradient descent
algorithm which exploits the convexity of the GGI
aggregation function, and controls the exploration
in a careful way achieving a distribution-free regret
˜O(T −1/2) with high probability. We test our
algorithm on synthetic data as well as on an electric
battery control problem where the goal is to trade
off the use of the different cells of a battery in
order to balance their respective degradation rates.

1. Introduction

The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem (or bandit problem)
refers to an iterative decision making problem in which an
agent repeatedly chooses among K options, metaphorically
corresponding to pulling one of K arms of a bandit machine.
In each round, the agent receives a random payoff, which
is a reward or a cost that depends on the arm being selected.
The agent’s goal is to optimize an evaluation metric, e.g., the
error rate (expected percentage of times a suboptimal arm is
played) or the cumulative regret (difference between the sum
of payoffs obtained and the (expected) payoffs that could
have been obtained by selecting the best arm in each round).
In the stochastic multi-armed bandit setup, the payoffs are
assumed to obey ﬁxed distributions that can vary with the
arms but do not change with time. To achieve the desired goal,

the agent has to tackle the classical exploration/exploitation
dilemma: It has to properly balance the pulling of arms
that were found to yield low costs in earlier rounds and the
selection of arms that have not yet been tested often enough
(Auer et al., 2002a; Lai & Robbins, 1985).

The bandit setup has become the standard modeling
framework for many practical applications, such as online
advertisement (Slivkins, 2014) or medical treatment design
(Press, 2009) to name a few. In these tasks, the feedback is
formulated as a single real value. However many real-world
online learning problems are rather multi-objective, i.e., the
feedback consists of a vectorial payoffs. For example, in our
motivating example, namely an electric battery control prob-
lem, the learner tries to discover a “best” battery controller,
which balances the degradation rates of the battery cells (i.e.,
components of a battery), among a set of controllers while
facing a stochastic power demand. Besides, there are several
studies published recently that consider multi-objective
sequential decision problem under uncertainty (Drugan &
Now´e, 2013; Roijers et al., 2013; Mahdavi et al., 2013).

In this paper, we formalize the multi-objective multi-armed
bandit setting where the feedback received by the agent is in
the form of a D-dimensional cost vector. The goal here is to
be both efﬁcient, i.e., minimize the cumulative cost for each
objective, and fair, i.e., balance the different objectives. One
natural way to ensure this is to try to ﬁnd a cost vector on the
Pareto front that is closest to the origin or to some other ideal
point. A generalization of this approach (when using the
inﬁnite norm) is the Generalized Gini Index (GGI), a well-
known inequality measure in economics (Weymark, 1981).

GGI is convex, which suggests applying the Online
Convex Optimization (OCO) techniques (Hazan, 2016;
Shalev-Shwartz, 2012). However, a direct application of this
technique may fail to optimize GGI under noise, because
the objective can be only observed with a bias that is induced
by the randomness of the cost vectors and by the fact that the
performance is measured by the function value of the average
cost instead of the average of the costs’ function value. The
solution we propose is an online learning algorithm which
is based on Online Gradient Descent (OGD) (Zinkevich,
2003; Hazan, 2016) with additional exploration that enables
us to control the bias of the objective function. We also show
that its regret is almost optimal: up to a logarithmic factor,

it matches the distribution-free lower bound of the stochastic
bandit problem (Auer et al., 2002b), which naturally applies
to our setup when the feedback is one-dimensional.

The paper is organized as follows: after we introduce the
formal learning setup, we brieﬂy recall the necessary notions
from multi-objective optimization in Section 3. Next, in
Section 4, GGI is introduced and some of its properties are
described. In Sections 5 and 6, we present how to compute
the optimal policy for GGI, and deﬁne the regret notion.
Section 7 contains our main results where we deﬁne our
OGD-based algorithm and analyze its regret. In Section
8, we test our algorithm and demonstrate its versatility in
synthetic and real-world battery-control experiments. In
Section 9, we provide a survey of related work, and ﬁnally
conclude the paper in Section 10.

2. Formal setup

The multi-armed or K-armed bandit problem is speciﬁed
by real-valued random variables X1, . . . , XK associated,
respectively, with K arms (that we simply identify by
In each time step t, the online
the numbers 1, . . . , K).
learner selects one and obtains a random sample of the
corresponding distributions. These samples, which are
called costs, are assumed to be independent of all previous
actions and costs.1 The goal of the learner can be deﬁned
in different ways, such as minimizing the sum of costs over
time (Lai & Robbins, 1985; Auer et al., 2002a).

In the multi-objective multi-armed bandit (MO-MAB)
problem, costs are not scalar real values, but real vectors.
More speciﬁcally, a D-objective K-armed bandit problem
(D ≥ 2, K ≥ 2) is speciﬁed by K real-valued multi-
variate random variables X1, . . . , XK over [0, 1]D. Let
µk = E[Xk] denote the expected vectorial cost of arm k
where µk = (µk,1, . . . , µk,D). Furthermore, µ denotes the
matrix whose rows are the µk’s.

In each time step the learner can select one of the arms
and obtain a sample, which is a cost vector, from the
corresponding distribution. Samples are also assumed
to be independent over time and across the arms, but not
necessarily across the components of cost vectors. At time
step t, kt denotes the index of the arm played by the learner
and X(t)
kt,D) the resulting payoff. After
kt
playing t time steps, the empirical estimate of the expected
cost µk of the kth arm is:

kt,1, . . . X (t)

= (X (t)

1Our setup is motivated by a practical application where
feedback is more naturally formulated in terms of cost. However the
stochastic bandit problem is generally based on rewards, which can
be easily turned into costs by using the transformation x (cid:55)→ 1 − x
assuming that the rewards are from [0, 1].

τ =1 1(kτ = k)) and 1(·) is the indicator function.

3. Multi-objective optimization

In order to complete the MO-MAB setting, we need to
introduce the notion of optimality of the arms. First, we
introduce the Pareto dominance relation (cid:22) deﬁned as
follows, for any v, v(cid:48) ∈ RD:

v (cid:22) v(cid:48) ⇔ ∀d = 1, . . . , D, vd ≤ v(cid:48)

d .

(2)

Let O ⊆ RD be a set of D-dimension vectors. The Pareto
front of O, denoted O∗, is the set of vectors such that:

v∗ ∈ O∗ ⇔ (cid:0)∀v ∈ O, v (cid:22) v∗ ⇒ v = v∗(cid:1) .

(3)

In multi-objective optimization, one usually wants to
compute the Pareto front, or search for a particular element
of the Pareto front. In practice, it may be costly (and even
infeasible depending on the size of the solution space) to
determine all the solutions of the Pareto front. One may
then prefer to directly aim for a particular solution in the
Pareto front. This problem is formalized as a single objective
optimization problem, using an aggregation function.

An aggregation (or scalarizing) function, which is a
non-decreasing function φ : RD → R, allows every vector
to receive a scalar value to be optimized2. The initial
multi-objective problem is then rewritten as follows:

min φ(v)

s.t. v ∈ O .

(4)

A solution to this problem yields a particular solution on the
Pareto front. Note that if φ is not strictly increasing in every
component, some care is needed to ensure that the solution
of (4) is on the Pareto front.

Different aggregation function can be used depending on
the problem at hand, such as sum, weighted sum, min,
max, (augmented) weighted Chebyshev norm (Steuer &
Choo, 1983), Ordered Weighted Averages (OWA) (Yager,
1988) or Ordered Weighted Regret (OWR) (Ogryczak et al.,
2011) and its weighted version (Ogryczak et al., 2013).
In this study, we focus on the Generalized Gini Index
(GGI) (Weymark, 1981), a special case of OWA.

2A multivariate function f : RD → R is said to be monotone
(non-decreasing) if for all ﬁxed x, x(cid:48) ∈ RD such that x (cid:22) x(cid:48)
implies that f (x) ≤ f (x(cid:48)).

4. Generalized Gini Index

For a given n ∈ N, [n] denotes the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. The
Generalized Gini Index (GGI) (Weymark, 1981) is deﬁned
as follows for a cost vector x = (x1, . . . , xD) ∈ RD:

Gw(x) =

wdxσ(d) = w(cid:124)xσ

D
(cid:88)

d=1

where σ ∈ SD, which depends on x,
is the permu-
tation that sorts the components of x in a decreasing
order, xσ = (xσ(1), · · · , xσ(D)) is the sorted vector
and weights wi’s are assumed to be non-increasing,
i.e., w1 ≥ w2 ≥ . . . ≥ wD. Given this assumption,
Gw(x) = maxπ∈SD w(cid:124)xπ = maxπ∈SD w(cid:124)
πx and is
therefore a piecewise-linear convex function. Figure 1
illustrates GGI on a bi-objective optimization task.

To better understand GGI, we introduce its formulation in
terms of Lorenz vectors. The Lorenz vector of x is the vector
L(x) = (L1(x), . . . , LD(x)) where Ld(x) is the sum of the
d smallest components of x. Then, GGI can be rewritten as
follows:

Gw(x) =

w(cid:48)

dLd(x)

D
(cid:88)

d=1

1, . . . , w(cid:48)

where w(cid:48) = (w(cid:48)
D) is the vector deﬁned by
∀d ∈ [D], w(cid:48)
d = wd − wd+1 with wD+1 = 0. Note that all
the components of w(cid:48) are nonnegative as we assume that
those of w are non-increasing.

GGI3 was originally introduced for quantifying the inequal-
ity of income distribution in economics. It is also known in
statistics (Buczolich & Sz´ekely, 1989) as a special case of
Weighted Average Ordered Sample statistics, which does not
require that weights be non-increasing and is therefore not
necessarily convex. GGI has been characterized by Weymark
(1981). It encodes both efﬁciency as it is monotone with
Pareto dominance and fairness as it is non-increasing with
Pigou-Dalton transfers (1912; 1920); they are two principles
formulating natural requirements, which is an important
reason why GGI became a well-established measure of bal-
ancedness. Informally, a Pigou-Dalton transfer amounts to
increasing a lower-valued objective while decreasing another
higher-valued objective by the same quantity such that the or-
der between the two objectives is not reversed. The effect of
such a transfer is to balance a cost vector. Formally, GGI sat-
isﬁes the following fairness property: ∀x such that xi < xj,

∀(cid:15) ∈ (0, xj − xi), Gw(x + (cid:15)ei − (cid:15)ej) ≤ Gw(x)

Figure 1. Point A is always preferred (w.r.t. GGI) to B due to Pareto
dominance; A is always preferred to C due to the Pigou-Dalton
transfer principle; depending on the weights of GGI, A may be
preferred to D or the other way around; with w = (1, 1/2), A is
preferred to D (points equivalent to A are on the dashed green line).
The optimal mixed solution is the black dot.

cost vector (w.r.t. GGI) is the one with equal values in all
objectives if feasible.

(5)

The original Gini index can be recovered as a special case
of GGI by setting the weights as follows:

∀d ∈ [D], wd = (2(D − d) + 1)/D2.

(6)

This yields a nice graphical interpretation. For a ﬁxed
vector x,
the distribution of costs can be represented
as a curve connecting the points (0, 0), (1/D, L1(x)),
(2/D, L2(x)), . . . , (1, LD(x)). An ideally fair distribution
with an identical total cost is given by the straight line con-
necting (0, 0), (1/D, LD(x)/D), (2/D, 2LD(x)/D), . . . ,
(1, LD(x)), which equally distributes the total cost over all
components. Then 1 − Gw(x)/¯x with weights (6) and ¯x =
(cid:80) xi/D is equal to twice the area between the two curves.

From now on, to simplify the presentation, we focus on GGI
with strictly decreasing weights in [0, 1]D, i.e., d < d(cid:48) im-
plies wd > wd(cid:48). This means that GGI is strictly decreasing
with Pigou-Dalton transfers and all the components of w(cid:48)
are positive. Based on formulation (5), Ogryczak & Sliwin-
ski (2003) showed that the GGI value of a vector x can be
obtained by solving a linear program. We shall recall their re-
sults and deﬁne the linear program-based formulation of GGI.

Proposition 1. The GGI score Gw(x) of vector x is the
optimal value of the following linear program

where ei and ej are two vectors of the canonical basis.
As a consequence, among vectors of equal sum, the best

therefore lower GGI values are preferred.

5. Optimal policy

In the single objective case, arms are compared in terms of
their means, which induce a total ordering over arms. In the
multi-objective setting, we use the GGI criterion to compare
arms. One can compute the GGI score of each arm k as
Gw(µk) if its vectorial mean µk is known. Then an optimal
arm k∗ minimizes the GGI score, i.e.,

k∗ ∈ argmin
k∈[K]

Gw(µk) .

However, in this work, we also consider mixed strategies,
which can be deﬁned as A = {α ∈ RK| (cid:80)K
k=1 αk =
1 ∧ 0 (cid:22) α}, because they may allow to reach lower
GGI values than any ﬁxed arm (see Figure 1). A policy
parameterized by α chooses arm k with probability αk. An
optimal mixed policy can then be obtained as follows:

Our goal is to minimize the GGI index of this term. Accord-
ingly we expect the learner to collect costs so as their average
(cid:0) ¯X(T )(cid:1) should be as small as
in terms of GGI, that is, Gw
possible. As shown in the previous section, for a given bandit
instance with arm means µ = (µ1, . . . , µK), the optimal
(cid:16)(cid:80)K

policy α∗ achieves Gw
the randomness of the costs are not taken into account. We
consider the performance of the optimal policy as a reference
value, and deﬁne the regret of the learner as the difference of
the GGI of its average cost and the GGI of the optimal policy:
(cid:16) ¯X(T )(cid:17)

− Gw (µα∗) .

R(T ) = Gw

(cid:17)

Note that GGI is a continuous function, therefore if the
learner follows a policy α(T ) that is “approaching” α∗ as
T → ∞, then the regret is vanishing.

We shall also investigate a slightly different regret notion
called pseudo-regret:

(T )

R

(cid:16)

µ ¯α(T )(cid:17)

− Gw (µα∗)

(10)

(cid:80)T

where ¯α(T ) = 1
t=1 α(t). We will show that the
T
difference between the regret and pseudo-regret of our
algorithm is ˜O(T −1/2) with high probability, thus having
a high probability regret bound ˜O(T −1/2) for one of them
implies a regret bound ˜O(T −1/2) for the other one.
Remark 1. The single objective stochastic multi-armed
bandit problem (Auer et al., 2002a; Bubeck & Cesa-Bianchi,
2012) can be naturally accommodated into our setup with
D = 1 and w1 = 1. In this case, α∗ implements the pure
strategy that always pulls the optimal arm with the highest
mean denoted by µk∗ . Thus Gw (µα∗) = µk∗ in this case.
Assuming that the learner plays only with pure strategies,
the pseudo-regret deﬁned in (10) can be written as:

which coincides with the single objective pseudo-regret
(see for example (Auer et al., 2002a)), apart from the fact
that we work with costs instead of rewards. Therefore our
notion of multi-objective pseudo-regret can be seen as a
generalization of the single objective pseudo-regret.

every time step t. However, in general, this approach fails to
optimize GGI as formulated in (7) due to GGI’s non-linearity,
even if the optimal policy is a pure strategy. Moreover, ap-
plying a multi-objective bandit algorithm such as MO-UCB
(Drugan & Now´e, 2013) would be inefﬁcient as they were
developed to ﬁnd all Pareto-optimal arms and then to sample
them uniformly at random. This approach may be reason-
able to apply only when α∗
k = 1/#K where K = {k ∈
[K] : α∗
k > 0} contains all the Pareto optimal arms, which
is clearly not the case for every MO-MAB instance.

7. Learning algorithm based on OCO

In this section we propose an online learning algorithm called
MO-OGDE, to optimize the regret deﬁned in the previous
section. Our method exploits the convexity of the GGI opera-
tor and formalizes the policy search problem as an online con-
vex optimization problem, which is solved by Online Gradi-
ent Descent (OGD) (Zinkevich, 2003) algorithm with projec-
tion to a gradually expanding truncated probability simplex.

7.1. MO-OGDE

Our objective function to be minimized can be viewed as a
function of α, i.e., f (α) = Gw(µα) where the matrix µ =
(µ1, . . . , µK) contains the means of the arm distributions as
its columns. Note that the convexity of GGI implies the con-
vexity of f (α). Since we play with mixed strategies, the do-
main of our optimization problem is the K-dimensional prob-
ability simplex ∆K = {α ∈ RK| (cid:80)K
k=1 αk = 1 ∧ 0 (cid:22) α},
which is a convex set. Then the gradient of f (α) with respect
to αk can be computed as ∂f (α)
d=1 wdµk,π(d)where
∂αk
π is the permutation that sorts the components of µα in
a decreasing order. The means µk’s are not known but
they can be estimated based on the costs observed so far as
given in (1). The objective function based on the empirical
mean estimates is denoted by f (t)(α) = Gw( (cid:98)µ(t)α) where
(cid:98)µ(t) = ( (cid:98)µ(t)
K ) contains the empirical estimates for
µ1, . . . , µK in time step t as its columns.

Our Multi-Objective Online Gradient Descent algorithm with
Exploration is deﬁned in Algorithm 1, which we shall refer
to as MO-OGDE. Our algorithm is based on the well-known
Online Gradient Descent (Zinkevich, 2003; Hazan, 2016)
that carries out the gradient step and the projection back onto
the domain in each round. The MO-OGDE algorithm ﬁrst
pulls each arm at once as an initialization step. Then in each
iteration, it chooses each arm k with probability α(t)
k , and it
computes f (t) based on the empirical mean estimates. Next,
it carries out the gradient step based on ∇f (t)(α(t)) with a
step size ηt as deﬁned in line 6, and computes the projection

The key ingredient of MO-OGDE is the projection step
onto the truncated probability simplex ∆ηt
K which ensures
that α(t)
k > ηt/K for every k ∈ [K] and t ∈ [T ]. This
forced exploration is indispensable in our setup, since the
objective function f (α) depends on the means of the arm
distributions, which are not known. To control the difference
between f (α) and f (t)(α), we need “good” estimates for
µ1, . . . , µK, which are obtained via forced exploration.
That is why, the original OGD (Hazan, 2016) algorithm, in
general, fails to optimize GGI in our setting. Our analysis,
presented in the next section, focuses on the interplay
between the forced exploration and the bias of the loss
functions f (1)(α), . . . , f (T )(α).

7.2. Regret analysis

The technical difﬁculty in optimizing GGI in an on-
in general, f (t)(α) − f (α) (=
line fashion is that,
Gw( (cid:98)µ(t)α) − Gw(µα)) is of order mink(Tk(t))−1/2,
which, unless all the arms are sampled a linear number of
times, incurs a regret of the same order of magnitude, which
is typically too large. Nevertheless, an optimal policy α∗
determines a convex combination of several arms in the
form of µα∗, which is the optimal cost vector in terms
of GGI given the arm distribution at hand. Let us denote
K = {k ∈ [K] : α∗
k > 0}. Note that #K ≤ D. Moreover,
arms in [K] \ K with an individual GGI lower than arms in
K do not necessarily participate in the optimal combination.
Obviously, an algorithm that achieves a O(T −1/2) needs
to pull the arms in #K linear time, and at the same time,
estimate the arms in [K] \ K with a certain precision.

(cid:80)T

The main idea in the approach proposed in this paper
is, despite the above remarks,
to apply some online
convex optimization algorithm on the current esti-
mate f (t)(α) = Gw( (cid:98)µ(t)α) of the objective function
f (α) = Gw(µα), use forced exploration of order T 1/2, and
ﬁnally show that the estimate f (t) of the objective function
has error ˜O(T −1/2) along the trajectory generated by the
online convex optimization algorithm. In particular, we show
(cid:80)T

The intuitive reason for this is that (cid:107) 1

estimate insigniﬁcant. Below we make this argument formal
by proving the following theorem:

Its proof follows four subsequent steps presented next.

Step 1 As a point of departure, we analyze OGDEstep in
(11). In particular, we compute the regret that is commonly
used in OCO setup for f (t)(α(t)).
Lemma 1. Deﬁne (cid:8)α(t)(cid:9)

t=1,...,T as:

α(1) = (1/K, . . . , 1/K)

α(t+1) = OGDEstep(α(t), ηt, ∇f (t))

with η1, . . . , ηT ∈ [0, 1]. Then the following upper bound
is guaranteed for all T ≥ 1 and for any α ∈ ∆K:

The proof of Lemma 1 is presented in Appendix A. If the
projection is carried out onto ∆K according to the OGE
algorithm instead of the truncated probability ∆ηt
K , the regret
bound in Lemma 1 would be improved only by a constant
factor (see Theorem 3.1 in (Hazan, 2016)). As a side remark,
note that Lemma 1 holds for arbitrary convex function since
only the convexity of f (t)(α) is used in the proof.

Step 2 Next, we show that f (t)(α) converges to f (α) as fast
as ˜O(T −1/2) along the trajectory (cid:8)α(t)(cid:9)
t=1,...,T generated
by MO-OGDE.

O(T −1/2) which is crucial for a regret bound of order T −1/2.

Next, we upper-bound the difference of regret deﬁned in (9)
and the pseudo-regret deﬁned in (10). To that aim, we ﬁrst

tion. The claim then follows by Azuma’s inequality.

τ =1[1(kτ = k) − α(τ )

k = (cid:80)t

Based on Claim 1 and Prop. 2, we upper-bound the difference
between the pseudo-regret and regret of MO-OGDE.

The proof of Corollary 2 is deferred to Appendix F.
According to Corollary 2, the difference between the regret
and pseudo regret is ˜O(T −1/2) with high probability, hence
Theorem 1 implies a ˜O(T −1/2) bound for the regret of
MO-OGDE.

8. Experiments

To test our algorithm, we carried out two sets of experiments.
In the ﬁrst we generated synthetic data from multi-objective
bandit instances with known parameters. In this way, we
could compute the pseudo-regret (10) and, thus investigate
the empirical performance of the algorithms. In the second
set of experiments, we run our algorithm on a complex
multi-objective online optimization problem, namely an
electric battery control problem. Before presenting those
experiments, we introduce another algorithm that will serve
as a baseline.

8.1. A baseline method

In the previous section we introduced a gradient-based
approach that uses the mean estimates to approximate the
gradient of the objective function. Nevertheless, using
the mean estimates, the optimal policy can be directly
approximated by solving the the linear program given in
(8). We use the same exploration as MO-OGDE, see line
6 of Algorithm 1. More concretely, the learner solves the
following linear program in each time step t:




Note that the solution of the learner program above regarding
α is in ∆ηt
K . We refer to this algorithm as MO-LP. Note that
this approach is computationally expensive, since a linear
program needs to be solved at each time step. But the policy
of each step is always optimal restricted to the truncated
simplex ∆ηt
K with respect to the mean estimates, unlike the
gradient descent method.

8.2. Synthetic Experiments

We generated random multi-objective bandit instances for
which each component of the multivariate cost distributions

Figure 2. The regret of the MO-LP and MO-OGDE. The regret and
its error is computed based on 100 repetitions and plotted in terms
of the number of rounds. The dimension of the arm distributions
was set to D ∈ {5, 10}, which is indicated in the title of the panels.

obeys Bernoulli distributions with various parameters. The
parameters of each Bernoulli distributions are drawn uni-
formly at random from [0, 1] independently from each other.
The number of arms K was set to {5, 20} and the dimension
of the cost distribution was taken from D ∈ {5, 10}. The
weight vector w of GGI was set to wd = 1/2d−1. Since
the parameters of the bandit instance are known, the regret
deﬁned in Section 6 can be computed. We ran the MO-
OGDE and MO-LP algorithms with 100 repetitions. The
multi-objective bandit instance were regenerated after each
run. The regrets of the two algorithms, which are averaged
out over the repetitions, are plotted in Figure 2 along with the
error bars. The results reveal some general trends. First, the
average regrets of both algorithms converge to zero. Second
the MO-LP algorithm outperforms the gradient descent algo-
rithm for small number of round, typically T < 5000 on the
more complex bandit instances (K = 20). This fact might be
explained by the fact that the MO-LP solves a linear program
for estimating α∗ whereas the MO-OGDE minimizes the
same objective but using a gradient descent approach with
projection, which might achieve slower convergence in terms
of regret, nevertheless its computational time is signiﬁcantly
decreased compared to the baseline method.

8.3. Battery control task

We also tried our algorithms on a more realistic domain: the
cell balancing problem. As the performance proﬁle of battery
cells, subcomponents of an electric battery, may vary due
to small physical and manufacturing differences, efﬁcient
balancing of those cells is needed for better performance and
longer battery life. We model this problem as a MO-MAB
where the arms are different cell control strategies and the

In the online convex optimization setup with multiple
objectives (Mahdavi et al., 2013), the learner’s forecast
x(t) is evaluated in terms of multiple convex loss functions
f (t)

K (x) in each time step t. The
goal of the learner is then to minimize (cid:80)t

while keeping the other objectives below some predeﬁned
threshold, i.e. 1
(x(τ )) ≤ γi for all i ∈ [K].

Note that, with linear loss functions, the multiple-objective
convex optimization setup boils down to linear optimization
with stochastic constraints, and thus it can be applied to solve
the linear program given in Section 5 whose solution is the
optimal policy in our setup. For doing this, however, each
linear stochastic constraint needs to be observed, whereas
we only assume bandit information.

In the approachability problem (Mannor et al., 2014; 2009;
Abernethy et al., 2011), there are two players, say A and B.
Players A and B choose actions from the compact convex
sets X ⊂ RK and Y ⊂ RD, respectively. The feedback to
the players is computed as a function u : X × Y (cid:55)→ Rp. A
given convex set S ⊂ Rp is known to both players. Player
A wants to land inside with the cumulative payoffs, i.e.,
player A’s goal is to minimize dist( 1
t=1 u(x(t), y(t)), S)
T
where x(t) and y(t) are the actions chosen by player A and
B respectively, and dist(s, S) = inf s(cid:48)∈S (cid:107)s(cid:48) − s(cid:107), whereas
player B, called adversary, wants to prevent player A to
land in set S. In our setup, Player B who generates the cost
vectors, is assumed to be stochastic. The set S consists of a
single value which is µα∗, and u corresponds to µIbalpha,
thus p = D. What makes our setup essentially different
from approachability is that, S is not known to any player.
That is why Player A, i.e. the learner, needs to explore the
action space which is achieved by forced exploration.

10. Conclusion and future work

We introduced a new problem in the context of multi-
objective multi-armed bandit (MOMAB). Contrary to
most previously proposed approaches in MOMAB, we
do not search for the Pareto front, instead we aim for a
fair solution, which is important for instance when each
objective corresponds to the payoff of a different agent. To
encode fairness, we use the Generalized Gini Index (GGI),
a well-known criterion developed in economics. To optimize
this criterion, we proposed a gradient-based algorithm that
exploits the convexity of GGI. We evaluated our algorithm on
two domains and obtained promising experimental results.

Several multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm
have been proposed in the literature (G´abor et al., 1998;
Roijers et al., 2013). Most of these methods make use of
a simple linear aggregation function. As a future work, it
would be interesting to extend our work to the reinforcement
learning setting, which would be useful to solve the electric
battery control problem even more ﬁnely.

control task. The regret is averaged over 100 repetitions and
plotted in terms of the number of rounds. The dimension of the arm
distributions was D = 12.

goal is to balance several objectives: state-of-charge (SOC),
temperature and aging. More concretely, the learner loops
over the following two steps: (1) she chooses a control
strategy for a short duration and (2) she observes its effect
on the objectives (due to stochastic electric consumption).
For the technical details of this experiments see Appendix G.

We tackled this problem as a GGI optimization problem. The
results (averaged over 100 runs) are presented in Figure 3
where we evaluated MO-OGDE vs. MO-LP. The dashed
green lines represent the regrets of playing ﬁxed determin-
istic arms. Although MO-OGDE and MO-LP both learn to
play a mixed policy that is greatly better than any individual
arm, MO-OGDE is computationally much more efﬁcient.

9. Related work

The single-objective MAB problem has been intensively
studied especially in recent years (Bubeck & Cesa-Bianchi,
2012), nevertheless there is only a very limited number of
work concerning the multi-objective setting. To the best of
our best knowledge, Drugan & Now´e (2013) considered ﬁrst
the multi-objective multi-armed problem in a regret optimiza-
tion framework with a stochastic assumption. Their work
consists of extending the UCB algorithm (Auer et al., 2002a)
so as to be able to handle multi-dimensional feedback vectors
with the goal of determining all arms on the Pareto front.

Azar et al. (2014) investigated a sequential decision making
problem with vectorial feedback. In their setup the agent
is allowed to choose from a ﬁnite set of actions and then it
observes the vectorial feedback for each action, thus it is a full
information setup unlike our setup. Moreover, the feedback
is non-stochastic in their setup, as it is chosen by an adversary.
They propose an algorithm that can handle a general class
of aggregation functions, such as the set of bounded domain,
continuous, Lipschitz and quasi-concave functions.

Proof :

K = argminα∈∆K f (α) of optimal solutions is a convex polytope. Additionally, it also holds that
maxα∗∈∆∗

Deﬁning, for a permutation π over [D] = {1, 2, . . . , D}, the set Aπ = {α ∈ ∆K : ∀i, j ∈ [D], (wi − wj)((µα)π(i) −
(µα)π(j)) ≥ 0}, it follows that f (α) = Gw(µα) is linear over each Aπ; that is, f (α) = f (cid:124)
π α, ∀α ∈ Aπ for some fπ ∈ RK
with component k deﬁned as (cid:80)D
d=1(wdµk,π(d)). (Observe that sets associated with different permutations can coincide when
w has identical components, and that non-coinciding Aπ and Aπ(cid:48) overlap each other on some lower dimensional faces.) It is
clear that ∆K = ∪πAπ . Additionally, it is also easy to see that Aπ is a polytope, noting that Aπ = ∆K ∩ (cid:84)
1≤i<j≤D{α ∈
RK : α(cid:124)bi,j,π ≥ 0}, where vector bi,j,π ∈ RK has component k deﬁned as [(wi − wj)(µk,π(i) − µk,π(j))] for 1 ≤ k ≤ K.
Finally, from all the above it also follows that f is a piecewise-linear convex function with linear regions {Aπ}π, thus the
minimal set ∆∗

K = argminα∈∆K f (α) is a face of one of the Aπ polytopes. 4 The ﬁrst claim of the lemma follows.

G. Battery control task

Efﬁcient management of electric batteries leads to better performance and longer battery life, which is important for instance
for electric vehicles whose range is still limited compared to those with petrol or diesel engines. An electric battery is
composed of several cells whose capacity varies extensively due to inconsistencies in weight and volume of the active material
in their individual components, different internal resistance and higher temperatures leading to different aging rates. As
a consequence, the energy output at any instant is different from each cell, which results in different aging rates and ultimately
leads to a premature battery failure. To address this problem, a control strategy called cell balancing is utilized, which aims
at maintaining a constant energy level — mainly state-of-charge (SOC) — in each cell, while controlling for temperature
and aging. Many cell-balancing controllers can be deﬁned, depending on the importance given to the three objectives: SOC,
temperature and aging. The values of those objectives should be balanced between the cells because a balanced use of all
cells leads to a longer lasting system. Moreover, those objectives values should also be balanced within a cell, because for
example, a cell can have higher capacity on a higher temperature, but at the same time it has a higher risk to explode.

Our battery control task consists in learning and selecting the “best” cell balancing controller in an online fashion, so that
it can dynamically adapt to the consumption proﬁle and environment, such as outdoor temperature. In the case of electric
cars, this means that the controller needs to be able to adapt to the driving habits of the driver and to the terrain, such as hilly
roads or desert roads. In this experiment, our goal was more speciﬁcally to test our multi-objective online learning algorithms
in the battery control task, and verify that our online learning algorithms can indeed ﬁnd a policy for this control task that
leads to a balanced parameter values of the cells.

The battery is modeled using the internal resistance (Rint) model (Johnson, 2002). The estimation of SOC is based on the
Ampere Hour Counting method (Dambrowski, 2013). The variation of temperature in the system is determined according
to the dissipative heat loss due to the internal resistance and thermal convection (Gao et al., 2002). Cell degradation or aging
is a function of temperature, charging/discharging rates and cumulative charge (Tao, 2012). Moreover, the battery model is
complemented with 10 different cell-balancing controllers. The whole model is implemented in the Matlab/Simulink software
package and can emulate any virtual situation whose electric consumption is described by a time series, which is given as
input to the model. In practice, such a time series would correspond to a short period of battery usage (e.g., a brief segment
of a driving session). For a chosen controller, the output of the model comprises of the objective values of each battery cell
at the end of the simulation. Note that the output of the battery model is a multivariate random vector since the power demand
is randomized, therefore this control task can be readily accommodated into our setup. In our experiments, the battery consists
of 4 cells, thus D = 12 in this case. The cell-balancing controllers correspond to the arms, thus K = 10.

The online learning task consists of selecting among these controllers/arms so that the ﬁnal objective values are as balanced
as possible. The experiment was carried out as follows: in each iteration, the learner selects a controller according to its
policy, then the battery model is run with the selected controller by using a random consumption time series. At the end of the
simulation, the learner receives the objective values of each cell output by the battery model as feedback and updates its policy.
The goal of the learner is to ﬁnd a policy over the controllers, which leads to a balanced state of cells in terms of cumulative value.

The results are shown in Figure 3. In this experiment we do not know the means of the arms, but we estimated them based on
100000 runs of the simulator for each arm. These mean estimates were used for computing the optimal policy and the regret.
We run the MO-OGDE and MO-LP over 100 repetitions. Their average regret exhibits the same trend as in the synthetic

Multi-objective Bandits: Optimizing the Generalized Gini Index

experiments: the MO-LP achieved faster convergence. The blue lines shows the regret of the pure policies, which always
selects the same arm, i.e., the performance of single strategies. It is important to mention that the optimal mixed controller
has a lower GGI value since the regret of any arm is positive, and more importantly, the two learners converge to optimal
mixed policies in terms of regret.
