Efﬁcient Online Bandit Multiclass Learning with ˜O(√T ) Regret

Alina Beygelzimer 1 Francesco Orabona 2 Chicheng Zhang 3

Abstract

We present an efﬁcient second-order algorithm
with ˜O( 1
√T )1 regret for the bandit online mul-
η
ticlass problem. The regret bound holds simulta-
neously with respect to a family of loss functions
parameterized by η, for a range of η restricted
by the norm of the competitor. The family of
loss functions ranges from hinge loss (η = 0)
to squared hinge loss (η = 1). This provides a
solution to the open problem of (Abernethy, J.
and Rakhlin, A. An efﬁcient bandit algorithm
for √T -regret in online multiclass prediction?
In COLT, 2009). We test our algorithm experi-
mentally, showing that it also performs favorably
against earlier algorithms.

1. Introduction

In the online multiclass classiﬁcation problem, the learner
must repeatedly classify examples into one of k classes. At

each step t, the learner observes an example xt ∈
[k].
predicts its label ˜yt ∈
In the full-information case,
[k] and incurs loss
the learner observes the true label yt ∈
1[˜yt �
= yt]. In the bandit version of this problem, ﬁrst con-
sidered in (Kakade et al., 2008), the learner only observes
its incurred loss 1[˜yt �
= yt], i.e., whether or not its pre-
diction was correct. Bandit multiclass learning is a special
case of the general contextual bandit learning (Langford &
Zhang, 2008) where exactly one of the losses is 0 and all
other losses are 1 in every round.

The goal of the learner is to minimize its regret with re-
spect to the best predictor in some reference class of pre-
dictors, that is the difference between the total number of
mistakes the learner makes and the total number of mis-

takes of the best predictor in the class. Kakade et al. (2008)
proposed a bandit modiﬁcation of the Multiclass Percep-
tron algorithm (Duda & Hart, 1973), called the Banditron,
that uses a reference class of linear predictors. Note that
even in the full-information setting, it is difﬁcult to provide
a true regret bound. Instead, performance bounds are typ-
ically expressed in terms of the total multiclass hinge loss
of the best linear predictor, a tight upper bound on 0-1 loss.

The Banditron, while computationally efﬁcient, achieves
only O(T 2/3) expected regret with respect to this loss,
where T is the number of rounds. This is suboptimal as the
Exp4 algorithm of Auer et al. (2003) can achieve ˜O(√T )
regret for the 0-1 loss, albeit very inefﬁciently. Abernethy
& Rakhlin (2009) posed an open problem: Is there an ef-
ﬁcient bandit multiclass learning algorithm that achieves
expected regret of ˜O(√T ) with respect to any reasonable
loss function?

The ﬁrst attempt to solve this open problem was by Cram-
mer & Gentile (2013). Using a stochastic assumption about
the mechanism generating the labels, they were able to
show a ˜O(√T ) regret, with a second-order algorithm.

Later, Hazan & Kale (2011), following a suggestion by
Abernethy & Rakhlin (2009), proposed the use of the log-
loss coupled with a softmax prediction. The softmax de-
pends on a parameter that controls the smoothing factor.
The value of this parameter determines the exp-concavity
of the loss, allowing Hazan & Kale (2011) to prove
worst-case regret bounds that range between O(log T ) and
O(T
3 ), again with a second-order algorithm. However, the
choice of the smoothing factor in the loss becomes critical
in obtaining strong bounds.

2

The original Banditron algorithm has been also extended
in many ways. Wang et al. (2010) have proposed a variant
based on the exponentiated gradient algorithm (Kivinen &
Warmuth, 1997). Valizadegan et al. (2011) proposed dif-
ferent strategies to adapt the exploration rate to the data in
the Banditron algorithm. However, these algorithms suffer
from the same theoretical shortcomings as the Banditron.

There has been signiﬁcant recent focus on developing ef-
ﬁcient algorithms for the general contextual bandit prob-
lem (Dud´ık et al., 2011; Agarwal et al., 2014; Rakhlin &
Sridharan, 2016; Syrgkanis et al., 2016a;b). While solving

Efﬁcient Online Bandit Multiclass Learning

a more general problem that does not make assumptions
on the structure of the reward vector or the policy class,
these results assume that contexts or context/reward pairs
are generated i.i.d., or the contexts to arrive are known be-
forehand, which we do not assume here.

In this paper, we follow a different route. Instead of design-
ing an ad-hoc loss function that allows us to prove strong
guarantees, we propose an algorithm that simultaneously
satisﬁes a regret bound with respect to all the loss functions
in a family of functions that are tight upper bounds to the 0-
1 loss. The algorithm, named Second Order Banditron Al-
gorithm (SOBA), is efﬁcient and based on the second-order
Perceptron algorithm (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2005). The re-
gret bound is of the order of ˜O(√T ), providing a solution
to the open problem of Abernethy & Rakhlin (2009).

3. A History of Loss Functions

As outlined in the introduction, a critical choice in obtain-
ing strong theoretical guarantees is the choice of the loss
function. In this section we introduce and motivate a fam-
ily of multiclass loss functions.

In the full information setting, strong binary and multiclass
mistake bounds are obtained through the use of the Percep-
tron algorithm (Rosenblatt, 1958). A common misunder-
standing of the Perceptron algorithm is that it corresponds
to a gradient descent procedure with respect to the (binary
or multiclass) hinge loss. However, it is well known that
the Perceptron simultaneously satisﬁes mistake bounds that
depend on the cumulative hinge loss and also on the cumu-
lative squared hinge loss, see for example Mohri & Ros-
tamizadeh (2013). Note also that the squared hinge loss is
not dominated by the hinge loss, so, depending on the data,
one loss can be better than the other.

We show that the Perceptron algorithm satisﬁes an even
stronger mistake bound with respect to the cumulative loss
of any power of the multiclass hinge loss between 1 and 2.

all loss functions in a similar family of functions smoothly
interpolating between the hinge loss to the squared hinge
loss.

4. Second Order Banditron Algorithm

This section introduces our algorithm for bandit multiclass
online learning, called Second Order Banditron Algorithm
(SOBA), described in Algorithm 1.

∈

SOBA makes a prediction using the γ-greedy strategy: At
each iteration t, with probability 1
γ, it predicts ˆyt =
[k](Wtxt)i; with the remaining probability γ, it
arg maxi
selects a random action in [k]. As discussed in Kakade
et al. (2008), randomization is essential for designing ban-
dit multiclass learning algorithms. If we deterministically
output a label and make a mistake, then it is hard to make an
update since we do not know the identity of yt. However,

−

cial to the mistake bound analysis. Furthermore, there are
some iterations where ˜yt = yt = ˆyt but we still make an
update. This idea is related to “online passive-aggressive
algorithms” (Crammer et al., 2006; 2009) in the full infor-
mation setting, where the algorithm makes an update even
when it predicts correctly but the margin is too small.

Let’s now describe our algorithm more in details. Through-

Note that this time-varying regularizer is constructed by
scaled versions of the updates gt. This is critical, because
in expectation this becomes the correct regularizer. Indeed,
it is easy to verify that, for any U

In words, this means that in expectation the regularizer con-
tains the outer products of the updates, that in turn promote
the correct class and demotes the wrong one. We stress
that it is impossible to get the same result with the estima-
tor proposed in Kakade et al. (2008). Also, the analysis
is substantially different from the Online Newton Step ap-
proach (Hazan et al., 2007) used in Hazan & Kale (2011).

In reality, we do not make an update in all iterations in
which ˜yt = yt, since the algorithm need to maintain the
0, which is crucial to the
invariant that

Our last contribution is to show how our second order al-
gorithm satisﬁes a mistake bound for an entire family of

loss functions. Finally, we relate the performance of the
algorithm that predicts ˆyt to the γ-greedy algorithm.

Putting all together, we have our expected mistake bound
for SOBA. 2

Note that, differently from previous analyses (Kakade

2011), we do not need to assume a bound on the norm of
the competitor, as in the full information Perceptron and
Second Order Perceptron algorithms. In Appendix A, we
also present an adaptive variant of SOBA that sets explo-
ration rate γt dynamically, which achieves a regret bound
within a constant factor of that using optimal tuning of γ.

We prove Theorem 2 in the next Subsection, while in Sub-
section 4.2 we prove a mistake bound with respect to the
hinge loss, that is not fully covered by Theorem 2.

Throughout the proofs, U , Wt, gt, and zt’s should be
thought of as kd

Proof of Lemma 1. We show the lemma in two steps. Let
1[yt = ˜yt = ˆyt], and Ht := 1[yt = ˜yt �
Gt := qt ·
First, we show that nt = Gt + Ht. Recall that SOBA
0. From
maintains the invariant (4), hence
line 14 of SOBA, we see that nt = 1 only if ˜yt = yt. Now
consider two cases:

The loss function �η is an interpolation between the hinge
and the squared hinge losses. Yet, the bound becomes vac-
uous for η = 0. Hence, in this section we show that SOBA
also guarantees a ˜O((L0(U )T )1/3 + √T ) mistake bound
w.r.t. L0(U ), the multiclass hinge loss of the competitor,
assuming L0(U ) is known. Thus the algorithm achieves
a mistake guarantee no worse than the sharpest bound im-
plicit in Kakade et al. (2008).
Theorem 4. Set a = X 2 and denote by MT the number
of mistakes done by SOBA. Then SOBA has the following

5. Empirical Results

We tested SOBA to empirically validate the theoretical
ﬁndings. We used three different datasets from Kakade
et al. (2008): SynSep, SynNonSep, Reuters4.
The ﬁrst two are synthetic, with 106 samples in R400 and
9 classes. SynSep is constructed to be linearly separa-
ble, while SynNonSep is the same dataset with 5% ran-
dom label noise. Reuters4 is generated from the RCV1
dataset (Lewis et al., 2004), extracting the 665,265 ex-
CCAT,
amples that have exactly one label from the set
ECAT, GCAT, MCAT
. It contains 47,236 features. We
also report the performance on Covtype from LibSVM
repository.4 We report averages over 10 different runs.

{

}

SOBA, as the Newtron algorithm, has a quadratic complex-
ity in the dimension of the data, while the Banditron and
the Perceptron algorithm are linear. Following the long tra-
dition of similar algorithms (Crammer et al., 2009; Duchi
et al., 2011; Hazan & Kale, 2011; Crammer & Gentile,
2013), to be able to run the algorithm on large datasets,
we have implemented an approximated diagonal version of
SOBA, named SOBAdiag. It keeps in memory just the di-
agonal of the matrix At. Following Hazan & Kale (2011),
we have tested only algorithms designed to work in the
fully adversarial setting. Hence, we tested the Banditron
and the PNewtron, the diagonal version of the Newtron al-
gorithm in Hazan & Kale (2011). The multiclass Percep-
tron algorithm was used as a full-information baseline.

In the experiments, we only changed the exploration rate γ,
leaving ﬁxed all the other parameters the algorithms might
In particular, for the PNewtron we set α = 10,
have.
β = 0.01, and D = 1, as in Hazan & Kale (2011). In
SOBA, a is ﬁxed to 1 in all the experiments. We explore
the effect of the exploration rate γ in the ﬁrst row of Figure
5. We see that the PNewtron algorithm,5 thanks to the ex-
ploration based on the softmax prediction, can achieve very
good performance for a wide range of γ.

It is important to note that SOBAdiag has good perfor-
mance on all four datasets for a value of γ close to 1%. For
bigger values, the performance degrades because the best
possible error rate is lower bounded by k
1
k γ due to explo-
−

libsvmtools/datasets/

5We were unable to make the PNewtron work on Reuters4.
For any setting of γ the error rate is never better than 57%. The
reason might be that the dataset RCV1 has 47,236 features, while
the one reported in Kakade et al. (2008); Hazan & Kale (2011)
has 346,810, hence the optimal setting of the 3 other parameters
of PNewtron might be different. For this reason we prefer not to
report the performance of PNewtron on Reuters4.

the value of the exploration rate γ (top row) and vs.

the number examples (bottom row). The x-axis is

ration. For smaller values of exploration, the performance
degrades because the algorithm does not update enough. In
fact, SOBA updates only when ˜yt = yt, so when γ is too
small the algorithms does not explore enough and remains
stuck around the initial solution. Also, SOBA requires an
initial number of updates to accumulate enough negative
t ntmt in order to start updating also when
terms in the
ˆyt is correct but the margin is too small.

�

The optimal setting of γ for each algorithm was then used
to generate the plots in the second row of Figure 5, where
we report the error rate over time. With the respective opti-
mal setting of γ, we note that the performance of PNewtron
does not seem better than the one of the Multiclass Percep-
tron algorithm, and on par or worse to the Banditron’s one.
On the other hand, SOBAdiag has the best performance
among the bandits algorithms on 3 datasets out of 4.

The ﬁrst dataset, SynSep, is separable and with their opti-
mal setting of γ, all the algorithms converge with a rate of
roughly O( 1
T ), as can be seen from the log-log plot, but the
bandit algorithms will not converge to zero error rate, but
to k
1
k γ. However, SOBA has an initial phase in which the
−
error rate is high, due to the effect mentioned above.

On the second dataset, SynNonSep, SOBAdiag out-
performs all
the other algorithms (including the full-
information Perceptron), achieving an error rate close to
the noise level of 5%. This is due to SOBA being a second-
order algorithm, while the Perceptron is a ﬁrst-order algo-
rithm. A similar situation is observed on Covtype. On the
last dataset, Reuters4, SOBAdiag achieves performance
better than the Banditron.

6. Discussion and Future Work

In this paper, we study the problem of online multiclass
learning with bandit feedback. We propose SOBA, an algo-
rithm that achieves a regret of ˜O( 1
√T ) with respect to η-
η
loss of the competitor. This answers a COLT open problem
posed by (Abernethy & Rakhlin, 2009). Its key ideas are to
apply a novel adaptive regularizer in a second order online
learning algorithm, coupled with updates only when the
predictions are correct. SOBA is shown to have compet-
itive performance compared to its precedents in synthetic
and real datasets, in some cases even better than the full-
information Perceptron algorithm. There are several open
questions we wish to explore:

Is it possible to design efﬁcient algorithms with mis-
1.
take bounds that depend on the loss of the competitor, i.e.
E[MT ]
kdLη(U ) + kd)? This type of
bound occurs naturally in the full information multiclass
online learning setting, (see e.g. Theorem 1), or in multi-
armed bandit setting, e.g. (Neu, 2015).

Lη(U ) + ˜O(

≤

2. Are there efﬁcient algorithms that have a ﬁnite mistake
bound in the separable case?
(Kakade et al., 2008) pro-
vides an algorithm that performs enumeration and plurality
vote to achieve a ﬁnite mistake bound in the ﬁnite dimen-
sional setting, but unfortunately the algorithm is impracti-
cal. Notice that it is easy to show that in SOBA ˆyt makes a
logarithmic number of mistakes in the separable case, with
a constant rate of exploration, yet it is not clear how to de-
crease the exploration over time in order to get a logarith-
mic number of mistakes for ˜yt.
